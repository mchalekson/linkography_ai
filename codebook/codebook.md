# Coordination & Decision Practices (CDP) Codebook

This codebook defines eight behavioral codes used to annotate utterances in SCIALOG scientific team meetings. Each code captures a dimension of team coordination and decision-making processes.

---

## 1. Idea Management

**Definition**  
Behaviors that introduce, elaborate, or block the flow of ideas.  
**Focus = idea flow** (are ideas being generated, elaborated, or stifled?).

**Positive Example**  
> "Let's run a pilot with undergraduates to test feasibility."

**Negative Example**  
> "That's a stupid idea, let's not waste time."

**Scoring (-1 → 2)**
- **-1** = Blocks/dismisses ideas.
- **0** = Vague/minimal idea ("We should try something else").
- **1** = Clear idea with some detail.
- **2** = Novel, elaborated, reasoned idea building on others.

**Theories**  
Creativity in teams (Amabile, 1996); task acts (Bales, 1950).

---

## 2. Information Seeking

**Definition**  
Asking questions, surfacing gaps, or discouraging inquiry.  
**Focus = questions asked / gaps raised** (how information is sought).

**Positive Example**  
> "Do we have the 2020 MRI dataset with patient metadata?"

**Negative Example**  
> "Why are you even asking that? Everyone should already know."

**Scoring (-1 → 2)**
- **-1** = Dismissive/rhetorical/accusatory questions.
- **0** = Vague ("I don't know").
- **1** = Clear but general ("Do we have the dataset for this project?").
- **2** = Precise, targeted, highly relevant question/gap.

**Theories**  
Functional theory (Hirokawa, 1985); Transactive Memory Systems (Wegner, 1987; Lewis, 2003).

---

## 3. Knowledge Sharing

**Definition**  
Providing relevant facts/expertise, or withholding/misleading info.  
**Focus = information given** (what knowledge is being shared).

**Positive Example**  
> "In my lab we used hierarchical clustering on 500 samples, accuracy was 85%."

**Negative Example**  
> "I know everything about this, so there's no need to discuss further."

**Scoring (-1 → 2)**
- **-1** = Irrelevant, misleading, or withholding.
- **0** = General claim ("I've done clustering before").
- **1** = Relevant contribution with some detail.
- **2** = Accurate, detailed, directly useful knowledge.

**Theories**  
Transactive Memory Systems (Lewis, 2003); expertise attraction (Guimerà et al., 2005).

---

## 4. Evaluation Practices

**Definition**  
Assessing the merit, quality, or feasibility of ideas.  
**Focus = judgments of ideas** (are ideas being critiqued, supported, or shut down?).

**Positive Example**  
> "This won't scale because of data size — let's test it on 10% first."

**Negative Example**  
> "That idea is garbage, it'll never work."

**Scoring (-1 → 2)**
- **-1** = Harsh/dismissive judgment, no reasoning.
- **0** = Simple approval/disapproval ("That's fine").
- **1** = Judgment with some reasoning.
- **2** = Constructive, reasoned, actionable feedback.

**Theories**  
Constructive vs. destructive conflict (Jehn, 1995); evaluation in Functional Theory (Hirokawa, 1985).

---

## 5. Relational Climate

**Definition**  
Expressing acknowledgment, support, enthusiasm, or sarcasm/mocking/attacks.  
**Focus = interpersonal tone** (how people treat each other socially).

**Positive Example**  
> "Thanks, Alex, that explanation really helped me."

**Negative Example**  
> "Yeah, whatever you say." / "That's a dumb question."

**Scoring (-1 → 2)**
- **-1** = Sarcasm, belittling, dismissive of person.
- **0** = Token acknowledgment ("Yeah").
- **1** = Explicit thanks/praise/interest.
- **2** = Strong acknowledgment that fosters trust or curiosity.

**Theories**  
Socio-emotional support (Bales, 1950); psychological safety (Edmondson, 1999); curiosity/affect in collaboration (Barsade, 2002).

---

## 6. Participation Dynamics

**Definition**  
Including/excluding members; balancing or dominating contributions.  
**Focus = who gets to speak** (how participation is distributed).

**Positive Example**  
> "Shannon, since you worked on preprocessing, what's your take?"

**Negative Example**  
> "We don't need your input here." / Constant interruptions.

**Scoring (-1 → 2)**
- **-1** = Excluding others or dominating talk.
- **0** = Generic invite ("Any thoughts?").
- **1** = Direct invite ("Alex, what do you think?").
- **2** = Targeted invite tied to expertise/topic.

**Theories**  
Collective intelligence & equal participation (Woolley et al., 2010).

---

## 7. Coordination and Decision Practices

**Definition**  
Structuring process, setting goals, confirming decisions, or derailing/forcing closure.  
**Focus = workflow and closure** (how the team organizes and decides).

**Positive Example**  
> "Our goal is to finish the methods by Friday. Lisa will draft, Alex will review. We all agree on option B."

**Negative Example**  
> "Forget the agenda, we're doing it my way, end of discussion."

**Scoring (-1 → 2)**
- **-1** = Derails process, dominating/premature closure.
- **0** = Vague/ignored process comments.
- **1** = Clear agenda/goals/decisions, partly enacted.
- **2** = Explicit goals, effective coordination, consensus decisions linked to tasks.

**Theories**  
Transition/action processes (Marks et al., 2001); goal specification (Hackman, 2002); consensus/closure (Hirokawa, 1985).

---

## 8. Integration Practices

**Definition**  
Summarizing/synthesizing contributions, or distorting/misrepresenting them.  
**Focus = how contributions are combined**.

**Positive Example**  
> "So far, we've considered Alex's clustering idea and Lisa's supervised method, with pros and cons of each."

**Negative Example**  
> "Everyone agrees with my idea" (false).

**Scoring (-1 → 2)**
- **-1** = Distorted, biased, inaccurate summary.
- **0** = Incomplete recap.
- **1** = Accurate summary of some contributions.
- **2** = Balanced, comprehensive integration used for closure.

**Theories**  
Shared cognition & information pooling (Stasser & Titus, 1985).

---

## Scoring Scale Summary

All codes use a consistent **-1 to 2 scale**:

| Score | Interpretation |
|-------|---|
| **-1** | Negative behavior (blocks, dismisses, excludes, distorts) |
| **0** | Neutral or minimal behavior (vague, generic, incomplete) |
| **1** | Positive behavior with some detail or clarity |
| **2** | Strong positive behavior (elaborate, constructive, actionable, targeted) |
