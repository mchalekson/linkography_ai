And then AI coupled with first principle calculations identify what are the type of defects or what transition metals that can actually be thermodynamic stable to make them and they are good to um for that application. And so then they guide the experimentalist that you know, don't build your material, molydenum disulfide for example with manganese. It is good, it is it is good for HER process for this catalytic process. And there has been a lot of discoveries actually that are like um again, I I I think in terms of the super conductivity that's also the same.
