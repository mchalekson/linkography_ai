And and and then maybe putting this together is that, you know, the the chemical and this is intuitive, but the the chemical um the destination of particular chemicals from my doesn't have to be the brain, right? In fact, it's probably hard to get it, but it could be an enteric neuron or or some other cell in the gut that then once you've, you know, sort of, you know, you're on the on ramp to the freeway and and and you can, you know, access that, you know, these these connections then the host does the rest, right? And so thinking about it's a combination of the two, right? So what's the chemical repertoire and what are the physiological repertoires, but those can be, you know, at at some point a chem there's a chemical initiation to the physiological response and then that can then go up to the brain either directly or indirectly.",

And that could you know, that gets into the bloodstream and it could either diffuse, you know and you know, go to other organ systems or it even could act locally on vagal neurons, which all have serotonin receptors. And so I think it's just complicated by the fact that all of these pathways are co-occurring at the same time that you have probably neuronal acting going on at the same time as diffusion of serotonin and other serotonin related derivatives um and it's kind of um difficult to account for the complexity of these happening in tandem.",

So to address this point of you know, are there ways to perturb neuronal function to watch the microbial response. And so a student in our lab uh delivered dreads to the ENS to specifically to TH positive neurons and to chat positive neurons. Um, and then activated them uh with C21 which is chemogenetics and then measured the microbiome and the metabo. And not only are they at least in this particular context, he stimulated 10 consecutive days before collecting the tissue. So take it for what it's worth. Um, uh the microbiome data is longitudinal at the metabo uh and the sequence contents for the microbiome are are at the last time point.

Um and the idea was at least initially that it was chemicals released from the brain in response to stress, presumably anxiety with the similar yet different mechanisms, but that that would cause increased ion transport, it would affect the the transporters on the epithelial cells, cause water efflux into the gut uh and then impact the tight junctions and that this was transient. So it was temporary for an acute stress and it was more permanent with the chronic stress. Um and things like corticosterone increase rapidly with the stressor and then they kind of flat line. So if you're going to do chronic stress, you'll still get activation but it's much lower and then that's associated with immune responses, um inflammation, damage, all those things. So there's and then that is associated with a dysbiosis. So acute responses to stress or anxiety are not associated with immuno immune activation and and microbiome changes. Those are more chronic. Um we studied most of those using using chambers and things like that. I don't know if that really answers the question but",
