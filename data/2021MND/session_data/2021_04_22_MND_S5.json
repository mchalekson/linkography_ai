Um, but my research focuses on precision medicine for developmental pediatrics. So, um, using precision medicine approaches like machine learning to better understand neurodevelopmental conditions, um, in children with neurodevelopmental conditions, essentially um applied to big data. Um, so this would include children with autism, intellectual disability, that sort of thing. Um, I think I'm here because my PhD, which is well before all my clinical training was in the neuroscience of the gut and the enteric nervous system and so, um, I have this I have this fantasy to combine this very basic science work I did in my early 20s with what I do now seeing patients with neurodevelopmental conditions and seeing if some of the strategies um that are coming out of science these days might be able to help my patients with some of their conditions.

Um and and and and then then applied um network approaches to reduce the dimensionality of the testing and then look for um uh association that can give us a hypothesis that we can test for example, um, you know, does short chain fatty acid shift the peripheral immune system in certain direction then therefore increase the risk for for certain neuroinflammatory disease as as a as a a testable hypothesis.",

Where the number of features you have way, way, way outstrip the number of replicas that you have. Um, you know, the the canonical way is to do exactly what Dr. Brian did, right? Is you have a hypothesis, you do the sort of the longitudinal well-designed experiment. Um, but that's the huge bottleneck, right? Is like there's really no way to sort of multiplex and model these gut microbiota uh brain interactions like how do you put these like on a 384 well plate? How do you throw these into like, you know, some sort of multiplexed highly efficient way to get higher end so that we can actually do the right studies that we want to do.

Thousands, you know, it's a lot and um, you know, not compared to like RNA, you know, not as much as RNA seek, but still a thousand is a lot. So what we do is if you actually use biological prior knowledge, um, those 1,000 different um metabolites can actually can actually be mapped down to like 50 or 60 or so, you know, biochemical pathways. Um, so I guess then the what you're leading to is, okay, man, I I started with a thousand features, but then you could really boil them down using biochemical annotations that's been around since the 40s, 50s or whenever, um, we only need to look at certain active, you know, biologi metabolic pathways, um, such as um, you know, like if you have a tryptamine, you know, what are all the tryptamine uh uh derivatives?

            "transcript": "this is a maybe slightly off topic and I promise I'll connect it back. So give me give me one moment of indulgence. A classic problem in neuroscience has been to look at like for example a neuron deep in the visual cortex, like an area of V4 and figure out what it is about the visual scene that makes the neuron spike. And basically forever neuroscientists were hindered by the fact that you can only get a limited number of observational data of like when that neuron spikes paired with the images that were presented to the animal. And there's a a huge um universe of different visual features that it could have been and there's a lot of non linearities between them. And it was basically impossible. Really recently like the past couple years work from my lab and others solved that. And what we did is we just trained deep neural nets to take an images and predict when the neuron's going to spike. So you take the the data of the image and the spikes, uh train your neural net to to predict when the neuron's going to spike. And then once you do that, we can invert that process. So we can synthesize a bunch of images that are predicted to drive high firing rates in the neuron. That tells us what the neuron uh responds to and of course if you then you can validate that by showing those images to the animal and verifying that you do get the predicted firing rates out. So I wonder if if a sort of data driven scheme like that of, you know, taking microbiome observations, predicting uh disease states or pathologies and then inverting those predictors might also help in this case uh similar to the way it does in in um neuroscience. That's more an approach than a organ systems comment, but",

So if you look at individual and individual change uh over time, that using that same person but at different time points as as sort of the um, the the comparators that that can give you some idea if you can correlate that with clinical outcome whether that's the onset of a disease or other intermediate phenotypes such as changes in the metabolome in the blood, etc. So that give you some sort of temporal having that temporal component uh give you some sort of uh, you know, not just association but maybe give you some sort of causal effect if you will.

This is something I'll just say while we're waiting for everyone to be back in the room. One of the things we do is is a study of how new collaborations form and what happens at the meetings that help to lead that so that we can adjust the nature of the meeting. So we actually look at who's assigned in whose rooms and how you interact with one another and then track that over time to see who chooses to write proposals whether those proposals are funded and who ultimately publishes papers together. Um and so we have data now 10 years running on the way that Silog functions to generate new collaborations among people.",
