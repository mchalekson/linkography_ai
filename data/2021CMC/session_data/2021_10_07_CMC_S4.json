But it's what is the master regulator? Is there something that's kind of keeping all these in check or and if we think about crosstalk, I maybe I can use that analogy, what's the language they're using and what are the rules of that language that synchronizes this crosstalk? That's something I'm always thinking about. Is it the cytoskeleton? Is it the metabolites? Is it just the temperature of the membrane fluidity?

So something that we try to connect is how our mechanical properties of the virus connected to the different stages of the life cycle. So for instance if you can relate the plasticity of the virus to a specific life stage and if that plasticity could be modulated by the addition of metabolites so for instance if certain metabolites are present in a specific region of the cytoplasm that communicates gets communicated to the to the virus and the virus then I'm just going to say make a decision but has the ability to sense those those regions.

But they're highly specific it's not an unregulated process so it's clear that that the virus has evolved to recognize those specific metabolites. That's the view that there is no well I'm using the word evolution but it's adapted to to recognize those those metabolites as a signaling element. Now actually I'm talking about lentiviruses and if you compare the lentiviruses are the ones that need to get into the nucleus but if you look at a retrovirus which can infect a cell that doesn't have doesn't need to go into the nucleus they don't they don't use those metabolites.

So in terms of our own research we're really interested in what part of what drives like one of the things that we're interested in is the circadian machinery is the the translocation of proteins sorry that's my dog behind me the translocations of of proteins back into the nucleus from the cytoplasm and and I I really oh sorry I'm just trying to scroll through I think Holly made the point about there are all these systems that people are looking at that are completely cell free versus cellular systems where the cellular systems are you're having a constant influx of energy and what is the role of that and how much does that change the dynamics of of what's happening in the in the actual cellular environment that people are trying to model. These are all just really I think interesting I don't have any answers but these are all really interesting points and I'd and I'd also raise two two things. One is that not all compartments are created equally right and so so how do we know what the the composition and the driving factors of different components actually are and different compartments actually are and then also how do we how do we track and follow and be able to study them in a more real time environment. I know mass spec was brought up right but but we want to have something that's that we're able to actually understand what is the time scale what is what is the change in in constitution or composition because one of the other things that I I actually put down is in terms of driving these components is is uh are how much how much involvement are concentration gradients right so the what's in not just what is inside of the the compartment but how much of that is inside of the compartment.

I I guess it's not even clear even for for for membranous compartments right since Holly mentioned we should give membranes a little bit of of due course as well. Like I just recently realized that people for instance in the field of plant biology when they simulate membranes actually just simulate model membranes that have like whatever POPC in them and maybe one or other thing and that's about it. But real plants have actually very complex membrane compositions that are actually totally different from animal membranes on top of it. And so to some extent these kinds of details must also matter because they sort of define what the phase transitions in membranes are and how proteins need to be embedded in them and how easily things can actually diffuse through the membrane like I mean there's membranes where water can even get through them reasonably easily and there's ones that are really very impervious and all of those kinds of things are going to control the dynamics of membranes. So even there I think there's a lot of stuff that we just don't know or or even if we kind of know it we're sweeping it under a rug and and not necessarily bothering putting it into our models even though it could greatly improve the models. Now there is speaking of technology and there are things that are coming a little bit to the rescue like like doing single molecule tracking is moving from sort of 20 nanometer resolution and and maybe milliseconds time resolution to like one or two nanometer resolution and microseconds time resolution now with new instrumentation available. So that should help because at least we're getting kind of the size scale of a single protein molecule and 100 microseconds is far away from the time that it takes to diffuse through a cell so now we can look at subcellular diffusion. But people here have mentioned metabolites and we're still far away from being able to image those and their distributions properly inside cells. It's often has to be like a mass spec experiment where you sort of break open the cell and interrogate what was there at that instant in time. And people are racking their brains what to do with infrared spectroscopy and other techniques to try and sort of maybe make that work for metabolites but I don't think anybody has come up yet with the like brilliant solution.",

And ways, experimental ways to characterize them are hard to come by and there's also another complication is that these membranes are not always like the each leaflet could be different, similar to the plasma membrane, there can be asymmetry across the the two bilayers. Something that we've been toying around with is neutron scattering of virus viral particles to see if we can fit, I mean we do molecular simulations, see if we can fit our molecular simulations with the power spectra that you get from neutron scattering. And the idea is to again, you know, kind of like the spirit of basic physical chemistry is if we our predictions from the molecular level can fit can tell us more about what is going on in the life cycle of virus. I think this something that Martin also mentioned which is this trans-layer diffusion, how lipids diffuse from one into another, also has consequences on the geometry and the morphology of the of these compartments. So, I mean this just adds to the complicated picture of these compartments and as Martin is saying and others have echoed, we don't really have high resolution information of how spatially there might be like so-called lipid rafts or they can be microdomains for these lipids and that definitely in our view has plays a role in in the life cycle of viruses. I imagine also plays a role in other cellular compartments.

So like mass spectrometry is inherently inefficient at creating ions. So they've incorporated this like secondary lasers to make it more efficient.
