There's no better illustration than that. So um I guess um I'm really interested to hear everyone's thoughts and contributions about how um I guess how to make science better. Um and some of us have a lot of experience so we can um you know, give you weigh in, but it's for you to discuss. Um and I think um I'd love to hear what you guys think works well and what doesn't work well in terms of um you know, scientific progress uh because we're all beholden to getting funding and promoted. And so are there things that are not working in that regard? If there is anything that's working well, let me know, but usually people have a lot more they think that is not working well. Um and so we'll do that and then we'll we'll brainstorm up some changes and uh and then we'll lastly touch on mentoring and we have an hour about to get through all this.

And so if there was some way to sort of get away from like numbers of papers or numbers of citations or order of your name on the paper like some genuine way to do it that's not just you know everybody gets credit for everything but like you can recognize excellence in a way that wasn't just indexed by numbers and author lists that was genuine that people could access and use I think that would be that would help I think.",

But now with all these databases you can click on H indices or whatever all that stuff is you know that's what people do because it's quick and easy to do. So and it and there's deep implicit biases there right you know people do this automatically and and I think this is one of those areas that's actually worth training people on. Like for instance I think the University of Illinois wastes a lot of time on ethics training that is not relevant to the kinds of things that we need to deal with because you know we're in Illinois and our government is corrupt and so we need to go through all of this sort of stuff.

So when I teach freshman chemistry I have this writing assignment early on where I ask them to flip through the textbook for five minutes and think about representation in the textbook and when the students write about whether or not they could find any human beings because maybe in five minutes if they have a slow internet connection and they're looking through the ebook they don't find somebody doing chemistry in their general chemistry textbook but a lot of them sometimes they find like Dmitri Mendeleev or Marie Curie and some of them say, I'll never be, I don't want to be a famous chemist or I'll never be a famous chemist and these intro textbooks they don't tell you that you can be a professional and you can be a leader without being a pioneer. And so there's this gatekeeping in intro science that's really I think unfortunate but maybe that's kind of on a younger level than what we're trying to discuss in this breakout room but how do we tell them that they can be scientists without needing to be extraordinary if they don't want to or need to.",

And when you were on one of these training grants you knew exactly how much you were going to TA and how much time you had for research because there couldn't be the surprise your your advisor suddenly doesn't have funding right if you got that funding you had it.

I wanted to hunker down with my family and not you know not work like I worked up to that point. Um and but also like over Zoom it's really challenging to celebrate accomplishments. It's it's really easy to talk about research with your students and your group and your peers and to get down to business and to minimize the time that you're on Zoom and and like I felt like for a year almost every interaction every virtual interaction had a harshness to it you know because we couldn't have lunch and we couldn't have drinks and we couldn't just you know physically applaud each other or shake each other's hands when something great happened in the group. Um we couldn't take pictures together we couldn't go to the park together you know so it's so there's yeah and collectively the grad students can't get together and share their experiences as easily like is this toxic or is this just stressful is this um are you being treated this way you know like their their ability to have these kinds of conversations are are very limited so that they can't you know they can't they might not know what's normal and be able to stand up for themselves as easily.",

So I feel like awareness is better but it is a really urgent need you know because a student in distress can be gone in a matter of months not you know so it's it's a pretty serious issue. But I do think institutions do have a role by insisting and I think the NIH has a role by acknowledging because right now when you send in your bio sketch I usually do mention mentoring in there but it's not part of the typical form right and I you know thankfully I work at a school that does account for mentoring at promotion if someone has any hint of an issue with mentoring in all of those letters that come in from around the world there will be a discussion you know because we take it very seriously but that could be a value for every school. You know why isn't it? Is can we make it that way?",

Sometimes I've found personally that like student support groups can be very effective at at being able to navigate some of the specific tensions and issues that students are encountering at a certain place in their career. But I think the other the other point that I was going to bring up is just you know all of the things that we were talking about the topics of of stress and expectations and sort of conformism if that's a thing is really kind of limiting the creativity of of students I think and I think that's really a crisis for science right now because even I think there was like potentially a time when there was a lot more freedom and just sort of individual just passion for something that may or may not have been recognized but when you're at a certain stage you don't know what's cool and what's not cool and I think that you know as things become more systematic and more processed and you have all of these metrics that are applied at earlier and earlier levels of how to get into grad school and you're in grad school how many papers you need and who you need to work for and what postdoc you need to get I think that's really eroding the creative thought of a lot of our students and and that's a problem and it would be nice to build in some mechanisms to just sort of reinvigorate sort of a curiosity that doesn't have as many consequences if it doesn't pan out in their CV. So if there were ways to sort of do that you know reintroduce that at the grad graduate student level I think that would really sort of at least help people preserve some sort of like naive creativity which is really helpful and useful in all discussions.",

I totally agree. But I still have a feeling you know having observed how this used to work you know and and how it's working now that if you're going to err on the 100-0 versus 0-100 side you're better on the 0-100 side where the 100 is the student's than the other way around.
