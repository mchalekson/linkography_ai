Okay. So given that then it might be nice if people could uh take five minutes to to think about the following okay so um in chemistry classes we all learn equilibrium thermodynamics right it's it's what we use to understand and predict chemical reactions. Uh but clearly pretty much uh you know a huge fraction of of anything we're looking at biologically is going to be uh quite far from equilibrium. Um and so uh what I wanted you to think about are examples of practical questions well I guess there's two possibilities one is an example of a case that you're familiar with or could imagine where that type of approach is going to you know get you into trouble if you're trying to make predictions for example. Um another side of that could be an example of a practical question in non-equilibrium thermodynamics because if you go try to read papers on non-equilibrium thermo they're pretty heavy right. I I am I'm a biologist in a chemistry department um and a lot of these papers are really much more than I could possibly deal with but there are um clear examples of of things that as a biologist I would like to be able to predict but but can't without the you know a developed non-equilibrium thermodynamics. So either focus on something where using equilibrium thermo gets you into trouble or focus on a question um of a kind of practical relevance in non-equilibrium thermo.

So the whole point of like life is this non-equilibrium metabolism and thermodynamics and you produce entropy and so this is kind of like you were talking about whenever I talk or try to read a physics paper on entropy I think it's different than what's in my head. But so you have glycolysis and respiration and respiration is closer to equilibrium you get more efficiency it's supposedly slower um you produce less entropy from respiration more entropy from glycolysis because there's a bigger delta G. Does does that affect the system at all? If you have a cell that was producing ATP exclusively through glycolysis exclusively through respiration does the output of that entropy so does the non-equilibrium thermodynamics affect the cell in any way?",

And that has been the paper in Cell in 2013. And now I saw just one, this is an idea that came into my head like yesterday, so it's very very fresh. But I've been reading already a little bit and last year was a cell paper where they looked at yeast and basically looked at what yeast does if it dries down, if it slows down its metabolic activity and actually compensates by making molecules that keep the viscoelastic properties of the of the cytoplasm kind of the same. So if a cell is basically running through energy or not has an impact on the properties of all the liquids inside. And some cells are trying to compensate for that, which is kind of interesting.",

And so if you grow faster you generally switch towards glycolysis, if you grow slower you generally move towards respiration. And it makes sense like you want to grow fast and so but is there a trade-off? And so kind of getting back to how you're how would you measure this or how does this affect the cell, is it noisier in the cell? And again how you measure noise is a it could be at the protein-protein interaction level, it could be at a gene expression level, but is everything a little noisier and so if we think about bacteria, they're just less robust, right? They don't live a super long time because they grow very fast and where humans grow very slowly and they live a long time. And so can could this be somewhat tied to these differences in entropy or enthalpy generation from these different metabolisms? And I agree that how do you measure this and whether a cell senses it or if it's just a byproduct of how cells work. I don't know if they need a sensor but the cells would work differently but can you measure that difference I guess? And that's always the thing I've struggled with experimentally of how would you measure this because it's such subtle things over very very long periods that I think it's going to be a very minor effect but accumulating over time.",

I mean that's kind of like the point.

That's you know that and and actually Holly your point about you know we abuse a lot of equilibrium thinking and apply it to steady state systems but it does actually work a lot right? And so that's a case where we can get away with some sloppy application and I wonder how much we how we would even start to understand like what kind of errors we can tolerate in our measurements but still make you know to see how much these non-equilibrium statistical mechanical ideas apply to biology.

Of course chemical equilibrium electrostatic equilibrium is one thing that drives it or even a channel forget a transporter but there's a lot of other very local electrostatic properties and and shape like just like pore filling and stuff that also contribute and that makes it that much harder to say okay we know all the players.
