For example immune response predictions genome mutation impact and network structure all of that. So I think the immediate goal I would say in the next in the near future would be to generate a chemical genetic interaction map. So that is really to facilitate precision medicine. So now I think the big question is like hey you have a patient coming into clinic with a new mutation we identify and doctor ask them to do a panel sequencing all of that. They did that and after that we don't know anything what to do next. So hopefully we can come up with a lookup table that you have these mutations and then their you know kind of associated unique drug and we can provide this is totally based on many different set of experiments that we can map to generate. And now it's like coming into a scale that we can manage a large number. Hopefully this will be the short term dream that we can achieve.",

So not every car has a Dojo but their Dojo is like their in-house computing platform. And and also it's it's really super cool because and this might be useful as you as experimentalists. You know that you have when you have a detector, it's not always going to be perfect. You've got to sort of correct for the detector in the machine. So the car has its its various cameras but they're not going to always be exactly in the same spot and linked to each other to do the processing. So when you first start with your car, it sucks. It doesn't it just barely shows you your car in in the image. And as it learns and gets feedback from the things it's seeing, it starts to realize that for your particular implementation of your car where your cameras are, how to triangulate and know exactly where an object is. And so the objects start to appear in the first 100, 1000 and 2000 miles that you're driving your car as it learns for your particular implementation. So it's it's sort of like a it's like a machine function and it corrects for the machine function of the application. And that's because it has its And that's like the next It had an initial amount from Dojo but then it had its specific neural net. So so you think about like what could you do in active processing if you're interrogating a cell with multiple detectors and in real time you are multiplying the interpretation of the detectors based on that particular cell and its locations that you didn't have perfect control over but you just get let the feedback let you know where they are.",

            "transcript": "Well I would I wouldn't say not necessarily. I mean I'll tell you actually I'll maybe start with a story. So I was at a Protein Society symposium a few months ago. There was a session on AI and ML in structure prediction. Ironically they came up with the program before the big press release on AlphaFold. And as far as I can tell actually that was the first time that they really had announced that they were going to make it a publicly available tool. So people in that session were extremely excited when John Jumper said that. But the other people in that session were pretty miffed. You know they definitely felt like you know they had been royally scooped. And to be fair if I worked directly in that space of trying to design AIs to predict structure I would probably feel that same way. But I do think that like as an experimentalist who works on protein folding, I would say that we're just really excited. We think this is an amazing tool. We obviously weren't competing with Google to do this and now we're just really glad that we can be beneficiaries of what I think is a truly revolutionary technology. I think that you know in terms of the concern, I think that when people say the protein folding problem, it's actually kind of a semantic issue where there really isn't one protein folding problem. I think you know when Christian Anfinsen kind of first used that phrase, he he did in Google's defense, he did actually use it to mean structure prediction. Of course what's happened over the last you know four or five decades is that we now know that protein folding is interesting for many other reasons other than being able to potentially predict structure. And so I think the term has kind of taken on more meanings than it originally had when it was first articulated. So that was just something I kind of wanted to clarify on. But I mean just to kind of like you know update a little bit because this is a space that you know we do a lot of reading and thinking on. They just came out with a preprint two or three days ago to predict complexes as well, like multimers, which apparently works pretty well. So it's pretty remarkable the rate of progress.",

            "transcript": "Yeah just want to follow up on that. That was exactly what I was trying to say. Because we work on protein-protein interactions and the network for a long time now. So exactly when it first came out the AlphaFold, the first question is can it really predict protein-protein interaction interfaces? The answer is no. And that's okay. And then when when you're talking to people more and more there are many things that AlphaFold didn't really yet produce and generate for us. So yes it's a very amazing platform there's no doubt. So we came up with this paper like almost like 10 years ago. So that was the first time when people predict that you know the protein interaction network generated by computational prediction can be of even higher quality compared to experimentally generated data set. They have proof of that, they have evidence, they have a lot of things and with really high quality and and things that a lot of times because of experimental failures, noise, batch effect and all of that. So apparently of course you cannot really compare to a carefully designed computational algorithm. So definitely see a huge application and potential that we can benefit from AlphaFold. But at the same time you know as Stephen Fried just mentioned now that a couple of days ago maybe last month this new paper came out saying that hey they were able to modify this algorithm to predict protein-protein interaction complexes. And my student has been working on that to see if we can benefit by integrating with PDB that I know Abhishek has been has mentioned there too to see if you can somehow use the prediction to broaden the stand to many different protein interactions and then figure out. I think the key thing that we want to do is to see the mutational effect, how that localized to the protein structure, the interaction interface. AlphaFold did perfect you know so in that regard we can we can really leverage that information and then model our network to really generate potential effect of mutations and then maybe also model a patient level where you have a set of five, six driver mutations, combination of them what will be the effect. I think it's just the beginning of many exciting things.",

But actually for people who are very familiar with PDB I think Abhishek may know this more than me, you are able to do generate the score, a quantitative score that compare the sequence similarity and structural similarity or structural differences. When you rotate the structure from the current position 90 degrees rotating, you say this is different. No, they are the same. So you have to have a way to quantify. So there is way that we can somehow see that single point mutation can really do generate the structural differences. I think you can look at that more for structure differences, folding and other things. We we just started, but I think there are for sure some interesting thing that AlphaFold can offer even in terms of protein folding too. At least we can see some sort of thing on the protein surfaces because we are interested more in interactions.

            "transcript": "I have very strong feelings about AlphaFold. It's fantastic actually, it's very very good. So actually my feeling is a bit different. I would not like to think about the 10 years in future with AlphaFold. I would like to think about the 10 years in future with Google, with what the CEO of Google is thinking might be potentially once he has gotten AlphaFold out. So now if we think in that direction, where did AlphaFold come from? The reason we really like this is because we essentially have a statistical mechanics kind of a mindset which really really kind of gets us into neural networks and and this sort of a multi-sequence alignment. So essentially as a community we were already highly biased on which this 500 million dollars investment is now being it's a we are we are return on investment. So in a way that's my way of thinking. Now let's think from a different side. Where did machine learning the way we are thinking over the last 20 years come from? The first wave was in 1960s where already Boltzmann motors, not Boltzmann generator but Boltzmann motors were generated. There's a second wave in 1980s and this is the third wave of machine learning holding the hands of GPUs. So from where I like to think is algorithms biology. There are seven different entry points of machine learning. Anything and everything that we are doing right now is the machine learning of neural networks, brain. How does the brain work? That is one way and we are what we are trying to do is we are trying to cast all our problems essentially in terms of how our brain thinks. There are six other ways. I've forgotten the names of the six others, one of them is quantum sensing. There are reviews in algorithms biology of these seven ways, three of them doesn't even have mathematical theorems derived. Let go of like it hasn't even reached computer science, it's in the applied math realm. So I think of machine learning, it's heavily biased by our interpretation of things. It's a virtual machine. So our interpretation is statistical mechanical which goes very nicely with this neural gas and and so this this is so this is very very good and therefore okay now now coming down to AlphaFold, I think therefore the next if we follow this track, I would invite everyone to look into the six other tracks. But if we follow this track, I think can we can we look into dynamics which is what I am very very interested in. In fact if you go to AlphaFold, they have a similar kind of work on dynamics on the website. They have been only able to train on three particle dynamics, they haven't been able to go beyond that. And not only that, one thing we are forgetting, training happens on TPUs not GPUs, very very highly sophisticated hardware which is not available on any public supercomputer in the country. It's only available with as a part of Google Colab, otherwise not. So I think dynamics would be extremely important to learn. The question is should we learn dynamics with neural networks with the way we are thinking about our brain thinks about things? Is that the ansatz to follow or should we think of other ways of machine learning altogether? And I think that's where I think we we we as biologists we can contribute because we know from from this biological side how does nature use seven algorithms. If we can treat this problem these seven that way, then possibly it's going to be easier. I know the reason of doing neural networks, LSTMs, GANs, the different kinds of objects also because now they are available, there's a lot of implementation. But can we think of it beyond that? I would say that's a possibility that sorry go ahead.",

I know Davide has a lot of thoughts on this and maybe Lu or Chinmay as well. So in this protein folding business, one question is if I have a structure or whatever, what's I mean if I have a sequence, what's the structure, etcetera, right? That's the sort of naive structural question which AlphaGo is answering. You could also do and people have been using machine learning, I mean neural nets to propagate a structure. So you can demonstrate that you can at least with simple all-atom models, you can learn a little bit of how to propagate from knowing our existing trajectories and propagate them. So you might even be able to use an AI to propagate a large protein and to be an integrator. And what Abhishek has kind of suggested is maybe that's that's like the obvious thing for us to do. We have an integrator, let's make a better integrator that uses the machine that is faster. But is there a different way in which we could think about dynamics or what's happening between these two, knowing the sequence and knowing the structure that would give us more information or different information that would be a different question that we need to address. So I'm I'm wondering what you all think about that and and that's my and I'm gonna and I picked on Davide and I warned him he was going to be the next person I was going to pick on.",

I think in in real life you you have different types of environments which probably affect the structure as well, partial folding or stuff like that.

So I think one key limitation is the the the quality and the completeness of the data provided for AlphaFold or for any anybody to model per se. I think because of the so many different factors involved that Lu mentioned like the environment and chaperone binding because I was working with Susan Lindquist on the protein folding before as well. So that's very important for the folding part and chaperone involvement. So all of that may be not really in there when they were modeling all of these structures before. So I think all of that you know one one key thing that we got from this ISCB like International Society of Computational Biology meeting just last month was exactly this. So it's it's limited now by the kind of data available to us. So that's why we have always room to improve in the future keep evolving all of that and then new generation of algorithms and data will be coming. Okay that's my comment.",

And I think that the reason why this doesn't work as well as let's say something like AlphaFold I think it kind of like boils down to like how good is the experimental data that you're trying to train off of. Like AlphaFold had the PDB. The PDB was just an amazing resource that has been accumulating for 50 years has you know all of these like you know forms of QC that are incorporated into the pipeline. You know we don't really have a database of that quality for all types of experimental data. And if we did I guess what the AlphaFold story has taught us is that we probably could create really powerful AIs to predict things but it's just like how good are we as a community at sort of putting all of our experimental data together so that the ML gurus can then go to town you know.",

If I train the same observations as a competition between observations it's a different kind of data. So it's my interpretation. I can give you like so many results out of the same data set by interpreting it differently. And and and that's where I often get stuck like my like at essentially that's where a lot of research happens is how do I take this data and and how do I interpret this.

So there is a certain amount of bias that has come out of known stoichiometry which creates an information bottleneck. These additional information you have to contact the experimentalist and then they'll give you what are the parts that they haven't submitted to the PDB which actually the physics will really benefit from. So and and and more and more so as you move from X-ray crystallography to cryo-EM where the data resolution is lower these the the population of these uncertain parts are increasing.

Uh what I find difficult is uh how do I validate generation things that I have not learned in the training set for example in the in the spike work that Rommie did they actually with Arvind they actually did uh went into a reduced space found some new confirmations that were not in the training set but that had to be validated which they did actually separately. Uh so something like that will have to be uh uh will have to be thought of number one. So I think uh how do we how do we validate generated models uh that's one point. And again when it's dynamics I would I would uh uh like to stress a bit the predictions that we were talking about Rigoberto they were what you call non non-generative models where you actually have to guide dynamics with dynamics to get the future. Uh essentially can we uh have generative dynamics like where we don't uh essentially feed the answer to get another variant of that answer where we start out with some sort of constraints and allow the the the model to to generate all sorts of answers and then validate it. So I think that's where uh uh I would I would say the training problem is not I think the bottleneck is the training problem is how you train things that depends on interpretation. Uh given a data let's say coordinate a molecule how do I tell a computer that it's a molecule do I give it all atom coordinates do I give it the dihedral angles do I give it the bonds and the angles do I give it like what what feature feature selection I think training is a simple process as long as we know how what feature do we choose and I think that's where most of the intelligence goes in of a researcher.",

The known unknowns are good because we know that we have expectations. So there is a there's a validation for that that we know. And then more importantly, when we go to unknown unknowns, how do we validate the unknown unknowns? So I was just trying to frame the question that it's a question of training and generation. So in the training, how do we how do we how do we train? Like what is the channel of training? How good an educator am I? That's the question that I often ask when I think of training somebody. How good of an educator am I? Like when I write an equation on a board, how do I teach my students that? So it's so that that that is exactly the problem I I I face all the time. If there are any thoughts about it, then I would be very then once I've trained it, I find okay, the students have learned exactly what I have given them. How would they how would they overcome my limitations? I have not found the first answer is possibly people have thought about it. The second answer I have not not found in any way. How does the how do I get out of the training set in a credible way? There are so many ways in which I can get out of the training set and it's not credible enough.

Like if you have this pool of images, when you train, you discriminate between the image that is expected versus not expected. And then based on that, and again the now the discrimination based on what features of that image, that's where the problem comes in. The discrimination itself is there. So I would say if I have to like, if it's not structural data, if it's image, I think pixels, I think you know, the intensity of of of of color in a particular pixel is a very good indicator of training imaging data. So if we if we know that, if we have real examples of a pixel by pixel intensity of a map, then that can be learned very well.
