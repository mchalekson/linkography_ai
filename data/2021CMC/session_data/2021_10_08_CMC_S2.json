Okay, so we have an hour and 15 minutes to get ourselves organized, so to speak, in this session on phase separation. Okay, so welcome everybody. I'm Cathy Murphy. I know some of you already, but maybe we'll and I guess I'm the only facilitator here. So maybe we can go around real quick. I'll call on people as I see you on my screen and what I'd like us to say is like your name, where you, you know, what department and university you're from, what your general thing is in terms of your science, and then in terms of phase separation, what your interests are in terms of this session. Okay, so I'll make myself a template here. So I'm Cathy Murphy. I'm in chemistry at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I'm a nanoparticle person, and so we normally do a lot of synthesis and surface chemistry and some biological applications and some environmental implications. We are interested in some proteins that don't have a structure and like can they form a structure on a nanoparticle surface. So my interests in phase separation in a cell would kind of be along those lines, like, you know, what's the role of proteins in particular that phase segregate in these little droplet things and you know, like what do they do and what are they like and what's their life cycle and stuff like that. So I don't do that stuff myself, but I'm very interested. But that's it's not about me, it's all about you. Okay, so Stephen from Johns Hopkins, you're next on my screen. So can you tell us about yourself and then your interest in separation and then we'll have to also get a organize ourselves in terms of writing and reporting, but let's go around the room first. And you're an expert at that because you already did it yesterday.",

I would say our lab is primarily a protein folding biophysics lab, but we make use of a lot of proteomics technologies and basically try to repurpose them so that we can study protein folding sort of more holistically and on more complex systems than the kind of conventional model studies. I would say I got most interested in phase separation when I read Alan Drummond's cell paper from a few years ago that sort of proposed this idea that like these protein coacervates could be functional and not just, you know, sort of a pathological state. But I'm really interested in trying to understand like do cells, you know, purposefully sort of package proteins away to try to protect them or does that carry some sort of proteostatic role and then what allows the cell to then sort of be able to fix a protein, you know, scoop it back out of that collection and resolubilize it again. So I'm really interested in questions like that.",

And like Stephen, I'm also interested in protein folding processes. But we actually look more at protein-protein interactions and the regulation and dynamics of these complexes and proteostasis pathways and how that's regulated in protein misfolding diseases and then also in virus infections, how they viruses basically take advantage of host cell proteostasis processes. But mass spectrometry is a great tool to study protein interactions, so that's also what what we use mostly in the lab and then coupled with some chemical biology tricks and methods development to kind of probe these processes. And so why I'm interested in phase separation is also in part because it does have this really important role in stress protection and proteostasis. But what's always puzzled me is that yeah, there are these intrinsically disordered proteins that do phase separate under different conditions, but what else gets incorporated into these membraneless organelles and are there sort of passive bystanders that get recruited? Are they still functional and what are they and what are sort of techniques that we can we can interrogate these processes?",

So we do a lot of CRISPR screening to identify the targets which are particularly important for certain cellular processes. We do liquid chromatography triple quad mass spec to to quantify the levels of modifications and my lab does high-throughput sequencing to look for those modified sites at the human genome. That's the three major techniques that we use. For phase separation, we have our interest lies on two directions. One thing we are particularly interested in nucleolus. We want to know whether the nucleolus is important for the biogenesis and the function of RNA modifications, especially ribosomal RNA modifications and vice versa, whether those modified sites that are participate influence the nucleolar condensates. Another thing is we are interested in sex-specific biocondenstate. My lab identified a list of proteins that is unique to male or females and they are all components in those condensates. So we wonder whether they would influence the condensate related sex-biased human disorders.",

But then also we have been engineering proteins to artificially control their phase separation inside of living cells. So we do this in bacteria and tuning electrostatic interactions to control phase separation to identify minimal sequences that can promote phase separation and then potentially use these for for engineering purposes.

So we are kind of a techniques lab, so we design and then apply single molecule techniques to answer interesting questions in biology and also in material science systems. So, you know, some of the things I heard about is maybe some things we could measure, for example, mechanical properties of these condensates. So for example, we use optical tweezers where we can apply force to a single droplet or we could apply force to a bead that's then conjugated to a biomolecule and we can then pull a single molecule and get information such as energy landscapes, transition states. So, yeah, so that's kind of the game we play. We design single molecule techniques and then look for interesting systems to apply them to.",

G3BP1 was considered as the core protein and the only one if you knock out that there will be no stress granules. However, another lab, a lab at Harvard, they actually used a super resolution microscopy and they identified N6-methyladenosine reader protein which is a RNA modification reader protein. They phase separate themselves and you can only see those phase separated puncta using super resolution microscopy and they serve as the seed to call for other proteins to join at only certain conditions to form different types of puncta. So there is a hypothesis in the field in the functional field that different size with different component compositions of the protein and RNAs would specialize those puncta condensate whatever you call them to different functions.

After 13 division you get transcription to start and you know all the proteins that make the nucleolus are loaded in the embryo so they are all there but for the first 13 cycles you don't see any nucleolus and then as transcription starts at the maternal zygotic transition you get nucleolus form. So the flies go by the first two hours of its life a fly embryo without any nucleolus in it and then as soon as you get transcription you you you start getting the droplet. And the same is true for the histone locus body. That's actually has been something that we have done in my lab has been you know you get them at about the same time and you get them as soon as you start transcribing. So without RNA they could still form but they're much smaller. So I don't know if RNA is necessarily the the you know the nucleator but it's definitely catalyzing the formation at least in the fly embryo. I don't know in the cells maybe the problem gets there some in cells in culture I don't know but it's a nice place where you can separate it because there's no transcription.",
