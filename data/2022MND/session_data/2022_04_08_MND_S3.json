So you could look at activity or other features. And I know that in mammalian models of uh of many of these diseases, there's a big focus on the cortex because it's, you know, what makes us human, but there's a lot of non-cortical regions and a lot of subcortical regions that I think are also affected and in even in a mouse, it you have to take out different pieces and assay them separately, it would be nice to get a bigger picture about the the whole flow of circuitry that might be disrupted to come up with hypotheses for then making organoids from different places, for example, um to in the brain to to look at specific features because I I pretty much imagine I mean, I think the microbiome is required for a lot of the normal developmental processes in many parts of the brain.

Um, it's hard hard to get them, I mean, many many parts of their body are altered without a microbiome. So, uh, for example, they don't have enough beta cells in the pancreas. Um, there are all sorts of parts of their brains where the circuitry is not right. And and many, I mean, uh, their digestive system doesn't complete its development properly. So there are very many aspects and you know, most of what we're looking at is early development. So what I would tell you is I think the microbiome is really critical for early development of every probably every body system except the ones that occur before they hatch out before they're exposed, which isn't to say that there aren't um then uh later features of those systems that are affected by the microbiome. And so, you know, it's it's not just disease states by uh alterations in the microbiome that are that are important to understand. It's the it's the early developmental process.",

Um, so we develop organoid models of the peripheral nerves, particularly the interic nervous system. And so with these organoids, we've been working on so far is trying to uh come up with ways to model different neurological diseases and how they manifest in the gut and the interic nervous system. And so that includes some neurological diseases that primarily affect the brain like Parkinson's disease. And so from there, uh that's where I'm interested in the gut brain access. And so so far not a ton of focus in my lab on microbiome, but then of course because they play such a huge role in the gut brain communication, that's where I hope to go in the near future. Um, so thoughts around anxiety or like other psychological disorders and the gut brain interaction. So something that I didn't notice on the list of uh topics to cover is I guess I would like to also get people's perspective on the opposite direction, you know, like or not the opposite direction, but really how treatments for psychological disorders or mental health disorders affect the microbiome, um and you know, the nervous system as well because something that um has been overlooked a lot is the fact that a lot of these medications that people take for these mental health problems directly affect the interic nervous system and that then affects the motility, which then affects the microbiome. So a lot of these correlative things that you could see in patients uh could be a consequence of medications that they take um as opposed to the actual disease and are there tools that we can use to uncouple that, first of all, to really get at causality, um and our animal models really the best way to think about that, um or do we need more in vitro based models to get at that question.",

Um, obviously with a lot of these things there's some potential genetic component, environmental component, um, some vulnerability towards developing these. A lot of these also like on the list, stress, PTSD, depression, anxiety, um, are not necessarily presenting early in life. So there's some sort of like build up or stimulus that's causing that issue, you know, a lot of people experience stress but the outcome of that is different um between people. So I mean, I think I think of it as sort of like a cycle for vulnerability within the gut and then for that contribution and then layering a disorder on top of that and then feeding back literally and figuratively, excuse me, with um perturbing the system and like exacerbating symptoms. Um, I went right into that but side note, um, I'm I'm Linnea Freeman from Furman University and I'm a neuroscientist.

Like I'm thinking for instance just elaborating on the the challenge that I was trying to talk about. For instance, if you look at depressed individuals, most of them have constipation, but it's most likely because they're taking SSRIs, which then acts on serotonin neurons in the gut that then causes them to not to not release enough neurotransmitters and cause constipation. So is it a microbiome problem or is it a direct effect of the medication or is it even a direct effect of the disease? So like depression, is it depression that's causing constipation or is it the SSRI that's causing the constipation? And where is the constipation coming from? And of course, if you have chronic constipation, you're going to have changes in the microbiome. So if you just look at microbiome and depression, you're going to see these correlations, but where is it coming from? So I think it's really important to think about all of these variables when you design these human based studies to like do this multivariate analysis and consider all these parameters and then in experimental models to really uncouple them one at a time. And that's something that I think is exceedingly challenging to do with mental health problems because animal models are really typically that we don't have the genetic diseases genetic models of depression in mice for instance.",

You know, we could be all looking at whether I discs shed differently in a whole bunch of different diseases and maybe we'd all jump on the I disc shedding train. I don't know. Um, so I do I do think that that's that's definitely a risk and it's where we need some of these causation studies where we do take naive wild type animals and and test microbial composition, um, and see if we can recapitulate features of any of these diseases. You know, I did have a really interesting conversation with someone in one of my groups yesterday where they saw changes in microbial composition in the gut after stroke. Um, and then they did fecal transplants from their stroke animals into naive animals and they saw hypertension in their naive animals. Um, and that felt like really nice confirmation that they could see a change and they could using the microbiome alone recapitulate features of that change. Maybe not every single feature of that change. Um, but some features of it. That felt very encouraging to me as somebody who definitely wonders like, are we just like all jumping on the microbiome bandwagon too fast sometimes.",

So I wonder if there's any effort similar to this with the microbiome, just like profiling and building that sort of huge database across different disease states and even healthy states across lots of individuals to start to be able to mind something like that, like, you know.",
