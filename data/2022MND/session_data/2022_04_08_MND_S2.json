Uh it has been, you know, this idea has been around actually for a long time. I remember I was a student and this smart pill thing was mentioned multiple times, but I haven't seen any really advancement and real thing rather than some passive components that they can go through and sample, sample like for example, go to intestine and sample bacteria, then the human or the subject um excrete that and then they collect the sample and do the traditional analysis, you know?

With brain, that's as at least like to some extent you say it's here, it doesn't move, that's another big problem. It doesn't move, it is fixed.
