Yeah, so I'm assistant professor uh at University of Illinois uh at Urbana Champagne just like uh Kai. Uh I have appointment in chemistry and neuroscience program. Uh so in my lab we have uh kind of like two big directions. One of them is to probe synaptic neurochemistry uh where we are developing a nanoscale electrode uh that can be positioned at synapses using scanning electrochemical microscopy. Uh we also have a second direction where we are developing uh implantable electrodes um for sensing um selective uh group of neurochemicals that are involved in cognitive activities. I call them like glad, like a GL means glutamate, A means acetocoling. Uh D like dopamine. Um so uh yeah, so so this is like you know another big direction and we also have interest in Alzheimer's disease as well as Parkinson's disease. Uh where my long-term passion is really to explore the effect of environmental pollutants on the brain activity. Um yeah, I haven't taught like environmental chemistry for several years at UIUC, which is a fantastic experience. So yeah, the class has grew a lot. Initially we have like maybe 130 students then eventually 180 students it just keep growing so yeah.",

You have a physical barrier which is the non steer water layer and mucus which by the way the mucus can be disrupted because of the bacteria, there are a bunch of bacteria that are mucolytic. Then you've got immune barriers primarily IGA dependent and then you have got the structure barrier which is intestinal epithelial and primarily through the paracellular path that between the epithelial cells that's regulated by apical junctional complex that can be uh those protein can be disrupted and cause a leach and that disruption is either through oxidative stress or uh cyto compact which clearly get uh disrupted or regulated by bacterial product.",

And the way we find out these are the patient or just only three patient that I happen to do colonoscopy and I happen to take the biopsy because of the polyp and then subsequently diagnosed with Parkinson at Rush. Subsequently the French group published the same things, but I think they had something like 20 patients. for there is rational to look at the gut for Parkinson and Alzheimer for the symptoms point of view, but again we tell you causality.",
