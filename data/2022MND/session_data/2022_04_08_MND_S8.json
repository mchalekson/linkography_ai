And so for C elegance is primarily gram negative uh either aerobes or or facultative anaerobes. Um and so yeah, we we sort of look at it this way is there's there's in terms of how it relates to human biology is there's two areas I guess that we sort of think about is is at the microbial strain level where what what levels of overlap are there there. And then like Annika was mentioning um what are the where are there conservation in in sort of molecular targets. And so are there conservations in receptors or receptor families. So in C elegance we have we have conserved monoamine receptor families, cannabinoid receptor families, opioid receptor families and in some cases those can be uh uh activated by similar ligands where those are sort of activated in in in mammals.

Um, the other advantage that, um, that I think about as somebody who's interested in aging, um, is that they while most people think flies live a pretty short time, they do live up to three months. Um, however, you know, we can look at aging on a much more rapid time scale than you can in other animal models. So we can we can do some of these manipulations in young and middle aged and older flies and follow them out, um, and kind of look at, um, at more complex, uh, uh, sort of environmental things than what you can feasibly do at a large scale in mammals.

Um, but on the other hand, you know, there you know, we we we have to just focus on the things that work, um, you know, and some of those things might not require large amounts of humanization, you know, we can things like knocking down conserved genes, like that's something these systems are good for. Um, so if we want to ask how are conserved signaling pathways and conserved neural circuits involved, that's, you know, that's a good question to ask in a worm or in a fly. Um, you know, how does microbial community structure shift in a in a human disease state is probably a bad question to ask in a fly.",

So I I was talking about this with someone else who said that like overall the the number or the amount of microbes in breast milk is really hard to measure because it's very low so it's hard to do like analysis of the constituent components. Um but sort of the the ratios of like basic, you know, proteins, fats, um uh microbes etc had this um circadian variability in um in humans as does, you know, total production volume. Um and that this was correlated with some metabolic um demands of infants around the circadian day in a way that was really fascinating to me as sort of an ongoing maternal care microbiome interaction.",
