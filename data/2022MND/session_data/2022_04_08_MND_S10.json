But the data um that we need it has to be so dense so longitudinal that I'm actually a little skeptical that we can actually come up with dynamic models. Um kind of like the when I say modeling that we do is um more towards um biochemical processes and metabolism which I don't think is very relevant to this discussion. But um one thing I'd like to add um regarding neurochemicals that that Ashley mentioned is um kind of the work we're doing is some kind of genome mining analysis where you could look at the genes of the bacteria of of any bacteria and see if they have something called biosynthetic gene clusters which are uh which produce natural products. Um natural products are secondary metabolites. They're not like the amino acids or lipids or uh sugars that we're used to or short chain fatty acids that we're used to but they're more like these complicated drug looking like uh chemical structures. Um kind of what I'm interested in the reason why we went this route is we're seeing all these bugs in the literature that is associated with diseases but I tell my postdocs all the time I don't care about the bug. I care about what they make uh about how they're communicating is it the small molecules is it the peptides that they're making. Let's get into that. Um so that's my long answer to no my models will not help here Ali but um using some kind of uh omics analysis whether it's looking at the genome whether it's looking at some kind of uh metabolic space like the metabolome or as you mentioned some kind of gene expression would at least point towards what are the biochemical processes that the gut microbes are doing that may be spit out into the chemical milieu and then go up through circulation into the brain causing some kind of uh degenerative auto um degenerate effect caused by inflammation.",

So I think that's really overlooked uh and like you say once there's inflammation there um that's kind of the last the last barrier before that signal is going to be disseminated uh throughout the body. Um so yeah I think that when Ashley was talking an interesting idea that came up was we've been able to track immune cells or label immune cells in the gut and then track them as they travel to the brain. Um we've done this by injection of dyes into the the Pires patches as well as as the MLN. Um it'd be really interesting to use some of these sensors uh in these discrete regions like the Pires patches to see what are the what are the microbial signals uh potentially neuropeptides that are affecting those immune cells in those regions and then how does that alter",

So we are asking the question uh whether loss of GLP one which by the way GLP one is produce production of the GLP one is augmented with short chain fatty acid. One can argue that this biosis with a low short chain fatty acid decrease the production of the GLP one and and so on and so on. Uh for with you but we are not measuring we are measuring the serum.

Uh but the higher dose it can. Uh but that is a very crude way of looking at the relationship. The other one in human that we are doing but I don't have that uh tool that Jay you have we are you you know about the extracellular vesicles. Yeah. Uh we now you know with the surface markers you can identify whether they come from the gut or intestinal epithelium or from the brain. You don't know whether they come from the brain whether they come from the microal or the neurons. Um and we showed in patient with Parkinson disease they have increased uh EV in their blood including uh gut derived EV. And and and we are not working with a group in uh Caltech to look at the uh cargo of the EV uh to for the proteomics. And apparently in proteomics world the annotation for bacteria drive peptides is woefully inadequate and we are not getting anything there but my hope is that if we show that you're going to have lots of uh the proinflammatory uh molecules that come from the gut and is associated with severely disease you may get some association using some of the modeling that you guys are doing but still not quite right. But so far in my opinion there are enough noises that gut inflammation has something to do with it but the direct evidence is missing. Now do you think that gut inflammation is promoting neuro inflammation is it because gut inflammation associated with this dysbiosis is all bacteria or is independent of bacteria? And how are we going to tease that one out? Because when you get gut inflammation you're going to get dysbiosis.",

So there is inflammation in the gut, there is inflammation in the brain. To me the biggest black box lies in the middle and this is something that I've struggled with in my own studies. If there's gut derived inflammation for me with hypertension and I'm still looking at brain inflammation. Why is it that that when that inflammation disseminates um that it ends up at brain. Um and then in chronic kidney disease it ends up at kidney. But you don't ever have it everywhere. So is there some type of second hit that's required in brain that's then drawing that inflammatory signal there? The we can do transplants to germ free and that would suggest that maybe it's not a second hit that's required if you can just change the biome and still see the same phenotype in one specific tissue. Um so yeah, I don't know if if there's it's two hit model that's required to get it there or if there's what what's what's the targeting mechanism to get that inflammation from to from one site to a very distant site.

I'm going to give my very vague analytical chemistry uh answer to this because I think a lot of times you know, I think I think more broadly to approach these sorts of difficult questions. A lot of times we're always in our own silos of what tools and techniques and methods of measurement and imaging and that we are uh great at doing and a lot of those techniques out there are really great for looking at very specific things and I think to actually solve these problems, we need silos like this where we're all coming together and bringing all of our expertise. I don't think one person's going to have the answer to this question. I think we all have to bring all of our different tools to the table. Um and then also some thoughts I had is it seems like we're always trying to figure out what came first, the chicken or the egg, the inflammation. And I mean, this may be my very simplistic view of the body, but it it seems like everything's in a constant feedback loop. So maybe it's not always inflammation came first and then this. It's not always a causal and effect. And I think there's a lot of different outside factors that could probably contribute to that. Things environmental stress. I know there's a lot of work now looking at stress and neuroinflammation and things like that. Um so I think it's complicated and I I I don't think there's a one size fits all solution to it, especially for human work because of how different all of our experiences on a day-to-day life are for sure that influences like what you were talking about where some people can drink their entire lives and be fine and others can't. There's got to be some other underlying, not just biochemical differences, but also, you know, stress and environmental factors that are at play there.",
