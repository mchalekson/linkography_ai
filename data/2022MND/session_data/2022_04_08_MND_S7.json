My glucose started to go up, I immediately didn't want to be prediabetic, I want to stay normal as long as I can, if I can, then I have a glucose monitor that tells me something about every minute of the day I I have it, I I know exactly.

But I think another um uh um challenge that I've sort of indirectly experienced in working with metabolomics data, um is that we're coming across a lot of molecules that we can't identify. I think that there's um a huge um uh set of of compounds that we we really struggle to kind of um to to to even know what their structure is. We know that things are changing or things are being produced, um, and that's that's been a big bottleneck for some of the studies that I've been doing. And I also think um and I I don't have a lot of direct experience with this, but those that do, I'm interested to hear, um, uh, the limit of detection, I think too, are the molecules that just because they're abundant doesn't mean they are and perhaps they may be even less important um if they're abundant in some context, um the ones that are really potent could be at really low levels, um, but still exerting outsized effect. So, I don't know, those are some of the things that have been challenges for my lab.

So that's gets back to kind of, you know, something Elizabeth was talking about with screening of things like GPCRs and and you know, finding targets can be powerful, I think, because then you you can actually start to loop into things like human genetics and like looking at at at different um uh people who have, you know, genetic diversity in in targets of microbial metabolites to try to better understand whether you know, a role for um a molecule in in disease biology might make sense. Um you know, JP you'd mentioned choline. I mean, I think one of the things that's kind of been tricky about about the products of choline metabolism is that nobody's really been able to identify a target for the end product that's been, you know, the product that was identified in metabolomic studies and it's been such an, you know, intense area of research. Um I that you know, and I know from trying to to, you know, interact with um uh people on kind of more of the the um drug development side of things that, you know, without a without a a mechanism, they're kind of hesitant to want to move forward with a microbiome targeted therapy.

These are partners, yeah. I wonder if we can like explore like study design. Calvin had mentioned like oh so do animal models or randomized control and Rima you mentioned an N of one. So studying a single individual and I'm wondering if given our um we know that the dynamics are so fluid and so unique to the individual for the human metabolome, is there a way to design an effective study that I don't know, I'm just like off the top of my head like we have nested studies but we're we're focused on a single individual, you know. Big and we know there are few people who are really doing this in a beautiful way. They load themselves with all kinds of monitors and they are getting metabolic profile and they we're starting to do some of this, right? And and learn about the individual. But clearly an N of one I I need to know what's good for me. At the end I want to know who is like me, right? Generally, but the focus is an N of one, right? You are right. an N of one where I can study this dynamics and what the where am I at different points and stages, right? Throughout and maybe at the end if I do not have a sensor that I can implant, right? Or that I can attach, maybe I can take a drop of blood on a filter paper to make this feasible, practical. Where am I going to go? I'm not going to go to a lab and get a blood specimen every hour or every day. It's not feasible. So as a community, we are also trying to say, can we make this something similar to inborn errors of metabolism where they, you know, every child who is born, they get a drop of blood, it gets on a filter paper, it goes to a lab, you get a read, are you susceptible to develop a disease, right? If you have a metabolic aberrancy based on your metabolic profile. So if we want to scale this and learn about the N of one and in real time, we're going to be sampling samples longitudinally. How do we do it, you know, is a big question. We are we are on it. We are thinking and doing something about it. We're not there yet. Yeah, it would be easy if I can drop a piece of blood, put it in filter paper, put it in desiccant, wait for an end of the week, I send 500 samples, yes. It teaches me about my metabolism, the the range. It also teaches me about my gut microbiome. Is there a dysbiosis? Yeah, we do cover quite a bit of metabolites of the gut, right? Um I can change my lifestyle and try to see if I can fix it. I can take probiotics, I can change my diet. Yes, I can try to do something that might work for me. That's the ultimate goal.

Um, I'm wondering about um what are so we there's so many metabolites. I think one of the questions is how do you triage? Um how do you we talked about it takes so much effort to go down these mechanistic pathways. Um and how do you um how do you decide, you know, like which which to to to target first and we've talked a little bit about but um like GPCR screens and others, but what are some of the others I guess is what I was thinking about. What are some of the like other high throughput screening in terms of targets that we can be thinking about. Um this also reminds me a little bit of um and Emily you might be able to provide better description of this, but um I remember in grad school like every time we made a new molecule we'd send it to the NIH for for screening of things. And I don't exactly know I was too um I was just focused on making the molecule. I'm not exactly sure what happened on the back end, but I I wonder if there's any analogies here to um the high throughput screening methodologies, but more importantly I think how you target what those targets are. Like what are what are you high throughput screening? Um we're doing this right now with like a single cell type that has a particular protein that we're interested in. Um that you means you do this for every cell type? Do you do it for um like the GPCR screens? Like what are how do we approach this? I think is a question that I'm really interested in because then we can look at hundreds and thousands of molecules and and then triage from there so that we know like that might be worth putting in all of this effort to deconstruct the mechanism. Um and then be able to to build from there. So I guess I'm just wondering if people have thoughts on what what what are the targets in that way that we might be able to screen for.
