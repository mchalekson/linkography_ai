Yes? You know, I give you an example, tryptophan, tryptophan can be metabolized to serotonin, to canurine, to right 5HIA or it can go to the gut and get metabolized by bacteria in the gut to produce indoles. Some of these indoles, right? Depending on what bacteria you have in your gut, you can produce indoxyl sulfate. We heard from the beautiful presentation of Rosie, some of the sulfated compounds, their their effect in autism, we see them now in depression, we see them in anxiety, we see them linked to cognition.

Um, I think often times at least I know from a very narrow point of view in analytical chemistry, like we all get in our silos of like what we're really good at measuring. Like yeah, I use electrochemistry and I I can measure only a subset of electroactive neurotransmitters really well, but I miss everything else that's going on. Whereas mass spectrometry can pick up a lot of other uh molecules that I can't measure as an electrochemist. And I think one of the things that to push technology forward is we need to start not necessarily combining these technologies because that might be impossible, but like combining these data sets we have to get a holistic picture of what's going on and actually working more together on the technology front to like potentially develop new technologies that can combine the power of mass spec and electrochemistry and imaging and all of these things together. Um, instead of just focus I I mean I am guilty of it as well is just looking at, you know, norepinephrin and dopamine and serotonin because that's what we can measure.",

Um, you know, like diet has such a big influence on the microbiome but also on the metabolites that, you know, are are are present and so some of those things are very difficult to control and so understanding those variations starting out could be really interesting. And I think one one possible uh way to think about this is is um instead of just purely measuring the metabolites themselves, you could potentially measure the responses to the metabolites by the host in some longitudinal fashion. Uh and that might give you a additional um kind of anchor for for thinking about this. Uh so you know, some of the emerging technologies in in in, you know, these like in vivo cellular recording systems, you know, they're still at very early stages uh could be, you know, one one form of this where if you can somehow integrate the transcriptome um into a set of packets that either goes into the genome that then you can sequence or, you know, secreted into a cell free format then you can then do kind of cell free measurements um in a in a more uh you know, uh longitudinal fashion. those those could be really useful as well. So I'm always a big fan of transferring difficult to measure uh things into things that you can sequence because that's to me the the most mature of any of the analytical measurement techniques. So if there's some ways where you can um convert any of these signals that way that could be really interesting.",

So so at least we have an ability to monitor in blood, we can monitor things that can affect these brain regions and we know these brain regions affected are implicated in disease. At least in depression, anxiety, we mapped exactly these sulfur containing compounds, they are changing and they correlate with imaging changes in areas that are relevant to disease.

I think that could also and to that could also improve improve clinical kind of scoring of of a lot of these things because a lot of the clinical ways that you know, you do autism spectrum or other things are are quite observational, but if you had more data that could nuance the the molecular differences between the patient cohorts, that could better stratify across many different ways in terms of the therapies that you would try to address those.
