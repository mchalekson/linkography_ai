Um, you know, this this is called the um lysogenic phase of the growth cycle, but um but what activates them from from the inserted you know, DNA content of viruses from coming out, that's that's really unknown, but it's been shown to be like, you know, anywhere from environmental stimuli to um um stresses towards the cell.

I actually my my postdoc and I have actually done some literature reading on this and surprisingly there's not a lot of um known evidence of how or why or when uh prophages are stimulated.

And the rationale for that was really this one animal experiment that got published um in a a pretty good journal, but they took the microbes from an MS patient, they put it in a germ free mouse and gave the mouse EAE, which is our animal model for multiple sclerosis and it got worse uh uh EAE than uh a germ free mouse that was transplanted with a fecal microbiota from a healthy individual's microbiota. So the MS microbiota was associated with worse EAE in the animal models when it was done in germ free mice, which is a it's a pretty contrived system and it's super interesting. But it is a contrived system because uh germ free animals have weird immunology in the first place and so if they lived with weird immunology until the point when you transplanted them, it's not given that their immunology is going to go actually behave like it otherwise might have, but it it is really interesting and that there may be either bacteria or metabolites within um an MS population that could impact disease in some way. Um, but I think we're it's it's um I don't know. It it's almost one of those things that you can do as many experiments as you want, but unless you just jump in and do something, you're never going to know if it impacts the disease condition in real life um because I don't know that there's really a way to take it up to that point. So we'll see. I know I know there's a couple kind of fringe groups that are trying to do fecal transplants in MS patients with transplant their microbiota with healthy individuals microbiota. There's some questions about the longevity. I don't tend to think it's going to be particularly effective though. Um.",
