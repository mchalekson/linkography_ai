Um I'd say that the well, a couple of things maybe, but in terms of the the one minute sort of idea or thing I'm thinking about, um you know one thing I'll just throw out there is sort of thinking about ways of building sort of multifunctional uh either interfaces or materials that that sort of satisfy a number of the requirements that you need for CO2 separation especially from air. So um you know so you you if you're doing CO2 capture from air you want something that's say oxygen that's not uh sort of sensitive to oxygen. Um you also want ideally something that's non-volatile so if you're doing this in an organic solvent you're going to have issues with solvent loss. Um and then you want something that's um redox active or that's sort of responds to an electric field or a potential and so captures CO2 in one state and then releases it in another. And I'm curious as to whether it it makes any sense and you know maybe in in typically what you would do is you pick the solvent and then you pick the active material and you sort of mix the two together you know you sort of build your system from there. Um I'm curious whether it makes sense to also think about trying to do or or make sort of multifunctional sorbents that would fulfill a number of these requirements simultaneously. So for example you start with uh like an ionic liquid for example which would not where you wouldn't have as much of an issue with uh volatility and that is sort of your backbone and then you sort of build on top of that some sort of functionality or something either redox active or electric field responsive that does your that does sort of the switching uh the sort of CO2 reversible CO2 binding and release component. So I'm just sort of that's sort of what I'm thinking about um is whether you could build these sort of chemical uh these these sort of new material systems. And then you you you know you put that in like a reactor um and one could then think about how effective it actually works in a in a real system but yeah that's that's one thought.",

But the um I think the one of the main problems is uh the ionic liquids are viscous and no matter you know how you design them they are going to be end up you know more viscous than your aqueous systems and that's one challenge and that kind of uh I think leads us into what kind of reactor designs can we have.

And that one has always been like you know is one more stable than the other? And the other one that I never really understood and I think it's a question for the chemists is uh I think the reason why the chemical engineers or the chemists picked quinones is because it has a reaction and it binds by reaction. But uh I never could understand like how does the chemistry affect the separation factor? Like if it's a quinone does it absorb everything even from direct air capture or are there different chemistries that can be more efficient at different concentration ranges?

So I would guess that the the selectivity factor must be huge for CO2 from a quinone to a reduced quinone. I would guess part of the problem is the reduced quinone is also probably oxygen you know sensitive that's one issue but um and the nucleophilicity is like you know modest it's a phenoxide essentially. So that's why I was kind of thinking about you know can we I was over here doodling random structures to try to find nitrogen-based um redox active things that you could reduce and make you know N minus or neutral amines which now we know have good CO2 capture.

And so if we plot the log of um the binding constant versus the redox potential we get a linear free energy relationship which basically just means that as we go more negative we bind better but obviously more negative means more oxygen sensitive. And so we're basically trying to find ways to get off that line uh so to speak right um so basically try to find ways to improve the nucleophilicity uh without um improving the potential. So the stability issue is partly the reduction potential and also in the um uh dianion form a lot of the CH bonds also tend to degrade for various reasons",

So many of us in this room work on CO2 reduction. So one of the things that we've thought about is instead of reducing CO2 let's reduce the it would be an alkyl carbonate or carbamate right these are the products of CO2 capture with amines and hydroxides or alkoxides respectively. And if we could just directly reduce it from there that's a solution. And I would argue that some of the CO2 reduction alkaline cells basically do that right because you're probably not reducing directly CO2 but you're reducing bicarbonate or carbonate at those pHs. And so I think that is an interesting approach and so sort of just re-shifting our thinking about CO2 reduction to reducing bound CO2 to some of these capture agents directly.",

But perhaps you could go to some other solid product you know not solid calcium carbonate but solid something else which is potentially more useful than calcium carbonate. But that's potentially an interesting direction. Because one of the things I always thought well with some of the mineralization stuff is that okay you take the CO2 out and now it's a solid that you can easily dispose of but can you make a solid that's as useful if not more than some of the traditional products of CO2 electro reduction.

Because I assume that in cabin capture it's really just like alkaline pellets, right? You know, ala Apollo 13 or something like that, right?

But they are interested in sorbents as opposed to zeolites. And in cabin you want something non-volatile, kind of benign solvent. And the good thing about we can think about also like pressure swing and in space vacuum is kind of free. So there are some advantages on that front. But I think they are also interested ultimately, you know, maybe like scavenging oxygen out of CO2 like through a Bosch type of reaction. But yeah, right now they are thermally regenerating at a much higher cost actually for zeolites and they also have to scrub, they they have to dry the air first because zeolites are not really stable with moisture.

You see you're taking, you know, you're capturing from 400 ppm and you want to go to one bar because you want to sequester or convert. If instead you still capture from air but your your requirement was only to go to like two or 3% let's say, that concentration of CO2 would be useful if you were doing something like algae. So like algae actually don't need to go all the way to 100%. If you if you get up to a couple percent, even 5%, they they can be pretty effective. So you can use it to do things like algae, like fuels for like aviation fuel or whatever. You can, you know, there's a whole bunch of other work engineering algae to make particular products, but but that could be sort of another like a sort of a step down the curve where you are doing CO2 capture and it is useful because you know, we're not going to get electric planes anytime soon. But you're not, you know, you don't have this massive concentration factor like 2500 or whatever it is. So that might be another way.",

            "transcript": "It depends on the process a little bit and it depends upon where your cost is in the process. So for example, you could sort of think of it as flow batteries are an easy example because you can separate power and energy and so if you want an energy intensive application, the cost is dominated by what's in your tank. If you have a power dominant application it's dominated by what it costs you to make the reactor. In these kind of systems it's a bit different, right? And it would probably the way you'd want to think about it is throughput, right? So it's kind of what is the capital cost of your reactor and then how much CO2 can you put through it because that's how you're going to make money, right? And so that's how you should think about it. I mean capital cost is important because, you know, bankability, like someone's got to pay for the thing, right? And so if you think about like the first solar cells, they they kind of stunk, right? But they're still working and they're small and you can put them on your roof, right? And so, if for electrochemical systems you could build at that sort of scale, local residential scale, and that allows you to do a lot more learning as you go and it allows you also to make smaller products which means that there's less opportunities for for screw ups and a lot less money involved. For a lot of sort of, you know, the larger scale systems like I guess carbon engineering, I mean I think that system is is is pretty big in the base case and I don't know how many of them they've built. I'm not so I've seen a lot of pretty pictures but I don't know if I've actually seen a plant. And so there's some something about like well who's paying for this? How confident are you that this is going to work? Yada yada yada this kind of stuff, right? So I don't think electrochemical systems can be infinitely small for sure. But you could be a lot smaller than thermochemical systems and actually if you look at scaling analysis, thermochemical systems can beat out electrochemical systems at large enough scale, right? Just because of heat integration, we're really good at that. But at smaller scales the tables turn.",
