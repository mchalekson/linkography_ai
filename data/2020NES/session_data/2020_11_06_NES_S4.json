You go hot you push the CO away. And then you have more sites for for hydrogen generation. And so then you need to up your pressure and so I was doing CO2 reduction at a thousand to 500 PSI of CO2 reduction. Which then completely changes your mechanistic regime. So this is a can of worms this is terrible like it drove me almost mad. So just that's all I'm saying. It's like I've been a little bit around this challenge.

CO is the only thing you will get.

It's nothing we can complain say low temperature can run much longer than that we don't.

Right? So if you're trying to interrogate a mechanism of CO2 conversion or capture in the liquid phase you know there's a certain amount of tools that you use like you could do online liquid IR you could do NMR whereas once you go into the gas phase you know the methodology is going to be different right? So aside from the chemistry itself you know that the study of the reactions also kind of has a different tool set right? And you know some of us are probably very familiar with the liquid analysis with some some gas here and there but",

At least in the field of homogeneous electrocatalysis, I think there these things are a little bit more worked out in terms of their Tafel relationships and extracting rate constants for a for a process or a maximum turnover frequency.

So if you think about the scalable conversion of carbon dioxide at meaningful industry scale, you have to think about the lifetime of your catalyst and associated with the cost of catalyst. I don't have too much experience with industry but maybe someone can chime in. What type of lifetime we want to achieve for catalyst for CO2 conversion? So I think the to me my limited knowledge seems the testing time for CO2 catalyst right now is about maybe I guess up to 100 hours at the moment which is apparently not good enough for scale up or long-term application. And also the I would add a different comment to Feng's comment. I think the the product selectivity, like you are doing any catalysis, selectivity is a very important, it's key, and which affects the ending purification, right? Purification is a very costly, expensive step towards final product. So I think that's two cents I would like to share.",

You know for for scientific speaking of course we are we are scientists we are very interested in how to how to play with the selectivity how to improve the production rate but for business it's totally different thing. And also you know if you look at the current chemical industry how people really doing these kind of process design usually they produce multiple products and they do the separation process and then separate out and they sell them separately or they integrate into a downstream process trying to make a high value chemicals.
