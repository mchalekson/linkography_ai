From my understanding there are a lot of defective oxide surfaces and how the thermodynamics and kinetics actually are going to occur on some of those surfaces I think is also critical. Not everything is known and what I feel is like we can use the defects a lot of times these surfaces have defects because there could be charge accumulation charge polarity all those other things. Those defects actually can we can use it to our advantage. I have to admit I don't know exactly how but I have seen it used to other advantage in other fields.

Carbon dioxide to us is like the world's the world's worst electrophile if you think about it right? And so if you can electrochemically generate a nucleophile from a compound that you can then break down from either introduction of an electron into an anti-bonding orbital you know there's just you know things like N-heterocyclic carbenes you know you can generate from simple imidazoliums that's a well-known reaction studied for for eons and you know just kind of trying to map out some space in that in that realm for us would be very interesting. So that's that's an idea an N-heterocyclic carbene nucleophile but I mean you can literally think about any other nucleophile or any other quinoid type compound you know it doesn't necessarily have to be a quinone per se it could be an enolate it could be you know just think of a nucleophile and it probably binds CO2 if it's strong enough.",

And so just thinking about those different conditions I think is important. And that when we separate CO2 it's not a separation from CO2 and nitrogen rarely. I don't know of a situation where it looks like that. So I I think it is also important to just think about as Kelsey you just mentioned not just the different concentration of CO2 that you're separating from that initial purity of CO2 but also what are the other gases that you have to kind of fight against you know when you think of selective CO2 chemistry.

So are there strategies one could employ to design more physisorbing sites that would still absorb CO2 selectively? And the nice thing about some of the inorganic or hybrid materials like MOFs is you imagine that your toolbox is huge for the types of sites that you could potentially design. So could you design a very high density of more weakly binding sites and still grab enough CO2 at these ultra dilute conditions without having to repay that massive enthalpy penalty that all these strong chemisorbing materials pay?",

You know we've been thinking about kind of things that bind carbon dioxide kind of from a zero order perspective and to us in a way you know once something is bound to a carbon dioxide it's a carboxylate it's a carboxylic acid that's lost a proton and there's just a lot of organic chemistry that could be happening there to convert a bound carbon dioxide to an alcohol for example by homologation by adding one C1 and so you know kind of an off the wall idea of electrifying the carbon dioxide capture component would be to just have a larger organic structure in which you can generate a nucleophile bind the CO2 and then convert that carboxylic acid to whatever you need and there are actually a lot of really old electrochemical methods to to to address that that that that that kind of process so that would be you know something that nobody's even thinking about you know especially like in the field of of carbon capture that would be a way to electrify the the carbon dioxide process for a for a more organic chemistry type application right? And a lot of these these molecules that people make that are kind of less than 100 grams per mole or so are are molecules that can be are that are commodity chemicals right they're produced on huge scale. So if we can find a way to to just leverage this this this carbon dioxide capture interface with an organic nucleophile converted to something that that that that is useful on scale you know I think that would be a great opportunity to to reinvent the way carbon capture is even thought about right?

Charm is one of them, Clean Energy Solutions, LanzaTech to some extent. But these these companies you know one of the things and and you might categorize this as BECCS a little bit. And so we we're familiar with things like blue hydrogen and green hydrogen but in the case of if you're using a biomass waste to produce hydrogen and in the production of that hydrogen you you separate out the CO2 and you store it you have the potential of producing negative hydrogen. And I think that you know that's something that's kind of new and I don't know if that's something you guys have given any thought to as an alternative source of hydrogen and it is a way of taking water out of the air because you're essentially using and exploiting photosynthesis right and CO2 of course. And there are some companies that are kind of thinking about this but not selling it in that way. But that's interesting. It's also just regional so you have to be careful because how much biomass waste is there out there? You know there's no silver bullet. But a little seed I want to plant if you haven't been thinking about that.",
