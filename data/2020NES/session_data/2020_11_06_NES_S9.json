So you can recycle this new fuel that are synthetic fuel to your capture system because in any case you need energy. So it it could be a loop that you are going to remove CO2 but at the same time where the energy is coming from the thermochemical, that one is another story, right? Because in any case we have to consider all the process that require in any case energy and this energy is going to release CO2 in the atmosphere. So I'm always thinking from cradle to grave. Well, I'm a chemical engineer with a background in process, right? So I'm always thinking from A to Z what's going on. Yeah, you can take energy but where energy is coming from, from the grid, from solar panel, from wind. Yeah, so in that case it could be completely negative emission and you can capture CO2 with with the normal sorbent that Climeworks is using.

So maybe you would have to look at the cycle whether the energy that you put in as electricity at the end what percentage of it remains as the hydrogen, right? But if you have a hydrogen economy, in theory you could pump it. Yeah. But making methane just so that you can pyrolyze it, right? If you cannot do direct pyrolysis from carbon dioxide, right?",

So if you want to take CO2 and put it in its lowest form, then the most logical pathway for that, at least what is in our consciousness at this point, is that of magnesium or calcium carbonate. It's an inorganic carbonate. And then if you actually want to take the CO2 and then if you want to upcycle it towards to a fuel, then the intermediate there, you'll need to identify it. It's typically carbon monoxide or maybe even a formate. So then the question becomes you can get to a CO, you can get to a formate, but once you have that, how do you get from there to your end goal, which could be a fuel, a polymer, or a product of some kind.

And so we can use this hydrogen to make electricity. And then on the other side of the membrane, I have most of the time I have a stream that is mainly composed by CO2. And so this CO2 can be also converted. So I can make well, not I, there are expertise that can make carbon neutral energy. So in that case we will have carbon free, carbon neutral hydrogen, you know? Because we are just going to furnish hydrogen but we are not going to release CO2 and also CO2 can recycle back in the process that if it will be electrochemical process, you know, or could be like Fischer-Tropsch synthesis and you can use for make from CO2 other ethylene or methanol or ethanol, any kind of synthetic fuel. I'm not I have no expertise what will happen after the CO2, you know?

And so you could essentially make basic water by electrolysis and then if you're bubbling CO2 through that you would make carbonates. But then it seems like you're limited in the where the salts are coming from. So I'm curious if maybe you could couple that with some sort of desalination technology.

So similar type of thing. So it certainly is viable just as MOFs are viable for storing methane and things like that. So I guess yeah if you yeah if you selectively capture CO2 from some sort of point source and then you would certainly be able to store it in the MOF and transfer it to another location. And yeah people have looked at a lot of like natural gas purification type things where you have like sour natural gas streams right so high pressure sources of CO2 and trying to make MOFs that will selectively store CO2 under high pressure conditions and that's kind of analogous to I guess what you would be thinking about if you wanted to have like a compressed CO2 storage stream so you could store like a really high density such that it was more efficient to to transport it or things like that. Um but that's certainly something that could be possible. I think yeah the parameters that you would need to optimize in a MOF for CO2 storage are basically the same as a reversible separation.
