So I just want to um throw out there that perhaps some of the constraints we might work under for different substrates would be different even working with like water or um fluid samples. So not everything can be pulled out of the air I guess. So just to kind of throw that into the thought process as well.",

The idea was to develop something universal so which works for everything. So yeah, there's a when we go universal route, there's a trade off that it cannot it won't work as great as the specific one, but it helps to reduce the cost and then it helps to scale it up. So we worked about method and we are doing validation for all S tech zero groups and salmonella and foodborne pathogens. So we call it UDP universal dual label proof essays. So what we found that we have challenges when we go into complicated matrix, but they were working fine with the all pure culture isolates. So that's what I am up to. And I think I figured out the challenges with food also, so that will be wrapping it up that one way to solve it something universal which is mass producible.",

Uh so I think that we have uh these really good uh technology uh but we need to be focused exactly what we are going to uh to detect and where uh in terms of uh to be a little focus focused um because we we the the technology that that Christopher is mention is is terrific is. So if we have the possibility to have in in in in one test or in like rapid test, the possibility or one or two to detect in general different species that can be affecting a specific population in a specific area that we have uh I don't know I'm I'm talking by by by my my experience for example here in in in Louisiana that we have this climate change that we have all these new uh these uh animals uh moving from different areas. How this movement how we can surve make a surveillance trying to detect what those animals are coming or um bringing sorry, I don't know uh to an area that we we we haven't that before. I don't know if that makes sense what I'm saying. So if we have the possibility to have an work in in in an specific question uh what we have in these areas that we have uh animals that we have vectors transmitting uh not only viruses, uh we have uh transmitting parasites, transmitting uh bacteria. The question is how we can predict or how we can do a surveillance with this general question. No? Okay, we have this new, we have this parasite that we we haven't seen this before, this this genome or this strain here. How is this going to to be a risk for the other animals in the area and human. Or the bacteria or and what will be in these animals or the um as as uh mentioned or no Jenny where exactly we are going to detect. I think you you you ask about the different materials, no? Is is not the same when we are doing uh diagnostic in blood that we are doing diagnostic in in feces or you know? So what is is the also for us or in terms of surveillance to collect from animals. So so these these are things that we need to think to to to put this this this area, this area and this area, the question that we have for this specific uh animals in this area regarding the environmental changes that they are suffering what this is different south southern US uh US from northern US. So we need to think on that and to have this specific rapid test. We need that now.",

Could be viral, could be parasitic, could be bacterial. Um, but maybe we we switch it over, right? We make it, okay, it's going to be type one interference. So, you know, you you put this under the skin of an animal and when that animal gets a viral infection, you don't know what that infection is, uh, that sensor is capable of detecting circulating type one interferon alpha, let's say. And it triggers a change in that receptor, sends a radio frequency signal that can be read from an, you know, from an RF reader say at a water tank. Um, you know, inside a dairy at the milking parlor, right? And it tells you that that animal isn't like something is going on with that animal, right? And it may not tell you what it is, but it tells you that something is wrong with that animal. And again, you can you can um utilize that information with a bunch of other things, right? As I was mentioning before, you know, motion sensor activity, temperature as was being suggested earlier, right? You can have all these things that are feeding, they're sort of feeding the system.

That's why something like temperature is very easy because temperature can be done in in all kinds of animals or or a microbial sequence will be the same in all kinds of animals. But a host based sensor even though it's very attractive and and is probably very um amenable to um artificial intelligence monitoring um just comes with the limitation that it's that there might be very strong animal to animal variability in terms of how much the test can be used.",
