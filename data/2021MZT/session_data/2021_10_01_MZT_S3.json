This the system is collecting data on a particular animal. It's feeding into an algorithm and then when there're changes in that pattern of behavior for that animal, it can flag of, you know, the manager, the supervisor and said there could be something wrong with that animal so at least it it keys you into you may not know what's wrong, but you know that something is not right. Um it's sort of that signal is coming to you. But again, I think the technology is there, it just needs to be developed and going back to, you know, how I started this conversation in terms of the infrastructure, right? Uh how are we going to pay for that? How are we going to pay for the, you know, the sensors that need to read um so there's quite a bit there, but I think the technology is working in that direction and at least in human medicine that's certainly taking off.",

You've got a um, uh, a a chemical species that exists in that environment and that causes the plant to change color and in irreversible way. Um, or or express itself with a color in an irreversible way. Um, some of that research goes back to uh, Dira project that was very interested in looking at weapons of mass destruction and the presence of of uh controlled chemical species. So think Sarin, think um, uh chemical stimuli like that that uh, these plants could act as a passive sentinel and express a color change if there happens to be and relatively quickly by the way, uh, if there happens to be the presence of a chemical uh agent like that. Um, lots of things to consider in terms of of concentration of of the the the the molecule you're trying to detect. Uh, this is not this is not natural for plants to necessarily do this, so it's a bit of a genetic engineering into a plant species that could express this uh um, this response. But are there are there things that vectors could ex would express as molecular um uh uh molecular expressions that's a terrible sentence. But hopefully you're following where I'm going, but do ticks and um, mosquitoes express chemical agents um, when they are carrying a particular um disease as the host or as the vector I should say. Um, or or what about something that is the um really the um the well for a disease that is not the vector but exists as you know, that's the natural state of the disease, a vector takes it from animal A and brings it to animal B through a um, you know, a tick bite or mosquito um harvesting of blood.

So it's literally just a small card with honey and the mosquitoes live in that trap will just continuously feed on that honey depositing saliva and then they'll test that honey card for virus as well. So yeah, if we could come up with something where there is a color change in a honey card from field collected um mosquitoes, that would be a game changer because that would cut the amount of effort you have to put into testing all of those cards in half.

So you would have a paper based passive um sensor that as more and more mosquito feed from it if they release if there's a release of some agent on that strip, it would change color. And then it could be made so that different strip are sensitive to different pathogens and something like this would be very simple to it could just be printed once the the active material is known it can just be printed, it could be left somewhere and collected uh every so often.

Uh, what happened over the years, the technology, the semiconductor technology improved to the point, we can make transistors like three nanometer size with feature sizes with three nanometers. That's like 30 atoms next to each other. So like, you know, I I believe top down approaches, basically taking technology and simplifying rather than starting with some simple and then expecting it to work.",

Are we trying to get a big picture that then we can say, okay, we know that there is a virus. Uh now let's go back to that side and figure out which virus, right? So, um, I I think Crystal was pointing to to that, right? That you can say, well, here we can tell you that there is some virus, but maybe go back later and so the precision is not necessarily telling you what the pathogen is, but maybe it's telling you that there is a viral infection or a bacterial infection or a parasitic infection. So it almost seems like um maybe the biggest challenge is that we need to think more closely in terms of what we are trying to what we're trying to accomplish and communicate that to the engineers, right? Because the engineers can say, oh yeah, yeah, we can we can develop that. We can we can do a color change, we can do um, we can we can develop a detection method, but then how do we use that information, right? How does that inform us? Is that really surveillance or is that just like, oh, we we have a color change, right? So, so maybe maybe that's part of of the problem is really identifying what true precision is for us and what does that precision mean in terms of decision making, policy making or going back and doing further, you know, further testing.",

Uh, and then we realized that actually this process of crossing is three different steps. There's the initial jump, then there is an adaptation which it um involves uh connecting with the immune system and getting the parasite to where it can live in uh its new environment, its new host. And then the ability to actually be spread among a human or livestock population and um the analogy of uh the step one there, the jump being the spark and um the step three being a raging wildfire is something that I'm going to come back to real quickly here.

Uh, so a lot of the questions that came at the inspiration that came uh in when we were talking about the spillover uh is what are the drivers? What are the drivers that are making uh that these pathogens make the jump? a lot had to do with ecology of the host uh uh and uh also the human involvement. So we were talking about uh animal migration and animal density have how that affects uh this spillover effects. But one thing that uh we also talk about is how is human activities affecting this? And one of examples that were discussed in the group was in influenza, how human migration into a certain areas where there are infected wild birds increases the chances of that spillover effect. And how and how we should be putting this human movement into predicting models. Like uh how do we gather that data? And one possibility is the use of cell phone data uh to monitor uh human movement. Uh, when we are developing these uh models to look into uh the prediction of spill over events. And uh because of that we decided that it's a good idea to start looking at metabolic and immunologic markers that can uh be surveyed in specific host populations and that can be included into models to then put it at an ecological landscape level. And to include also the microbiome data because we know the microbiome will also",

So are there ways we can model the best optimized surveillance networks to get the best bang for our buck. Um we we talked about the possibility of having universal assays of pathogens that we can use in many, many different systems. So you don't have to reinvent the wheel, you can use the same assays across diverse systems, um using variable tech.",

Um and and really we just talked about the gap of that communication barrier between the engineers and the biologists. So you've got a biologist who knows exactly what they want to measure, but they don't really know the engineering challenges behind how they get there. And then you have the engineers who know how to get there, but they're not entirely clear on on what the biologists are looking for.

Um and one of the big ones that we talked about kind of at length was um using chemical signals to sense pathogens in the environment passively. Um so, you know, possibly using sensor technology, um, you know, for like a vector born disease, if a mosquito deposit deposits virus on this color changing card and the card changes color, then we know that there was virus deposited there, we know there's virus in the environment. So talking about using um color changing technology to to possibly monitor uh pathogens in in the wild. Um and and it also came up talking about nanoparticle sensors, um where we've got antibodies on these nanoparticle sensors that will change color upon detection of antigens and and you can use that in diverse systems, it's not just vector born diseases, but also in situations where you've got um more directly transmitted pathogens as well in an animal, um animal to animal contact environment. Um realistically a big challenge is coming out with simple tools that minimize personnel requirements. Not everybody has, you know, a huge group of people who can go in and do a million PCRs and do a million identifications of mosquitoes and do a whole lot of this work. We need simple tools that can be used by anybody, possibly even a citizen science approach, um that will improve surveillance on a large scale. And then we talked about a very serious uh surveillance challenge on kind of smaller family farms that can be the source of disease because there can be barriers there where, you know, people don't want you to make that detection on their farm. It can mean something bad for their farm if you detect something in their animals.",
