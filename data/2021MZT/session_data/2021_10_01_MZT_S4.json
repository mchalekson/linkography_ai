I think that's a a key factor that at least in the work that I do we're trying to kind of understand for instance why in the bat there is a innate immunity like type type one interferon or type three interferon highly upregulated than in other uh animals. And so this allows a better control of viral loads in bats that prevents um the animal from getting sick. So I I I think those are are key aspects that we can uh kind of try to understand for for for when spill overs happen and that we can perhaps uh use that as developing of biotherapeutics or antivirals etc. I don't know.

Uh so in my PhD I did a lot of that with so sheep which are, you know, a wild animal where we're really trying to understand if there were some sort of like environmental cues uh that perhaps would push that spectrum from tolerance all the way to to disease type immune response. Uh and how that might actually change over time depending on uh how well um fed they are if if it was a particularly bad year um or if it's really just a kind of like a coevolution of the parasite and the host that allows them to tolerate but in the event of a of a stochastic jump that just kind of goes awry. Um but I I do agree that uh the sampling is is key uh but the sampling alone does not do it. It it definitely needs to have some sort of like field lab concerted kind of feedback loop collaboration um that makes sense to me. So I know there's a lot of people particularly in Colorado doing trying to do that uh with bats and other and ungulate species.

So a lot of what we're talking about is like in order to understand this, you need the right data, which if you want to understand the whole system, like if you want to know every virus in every animal in the whole system, that's not feasible. I I will just put that out there. Um so then like so there's has to be some way to target it. So one way people have done it is around disease events and sort of forward tracking, back tracking in disease events, which helps you target things. But that in some ways like from the epidemiologist standpoint, that's really biasing your sample, right? So you're missing all of the things that are going on under the radar when you do that and you tend to be looking at high consequence populations, right? So it has to be pretty big or it has to be humans or livestock mortality or something that that's kind of raising it to that level. Um can we understand the whole system just looking through those ways or are there some things that we could do to understand the system by looking at other strategies of narrowing down what we're looking at.",

But I guess when it comes to reservoirs and stuff like that, um, you know, you're kind of it almost sounds like you're kind of trying to test to see what's there, but how if if we're also talking about emerging pathogens, you know, to some extent you you're going to have to test for stuff that has the potential for going in there. So I'm trying to figure out how this relates to what's been being discussed with reservoirs because I mean, I know a lot of the stuff hasn't been tested, but, you know, take Japanese encephalitis virus or something like that where it's mainly considered, you know, in Japan a little bit in Australia, but, you know, it's spreading a little bit. So when you talk about maybe testing some of the reservoirs, are you would you for to see if it's emerging into like nearby areas, would you start testing those areas for JB although it had it hasn't been ever isolated there to see if there's any reservoir populations or something like that. And then if you are doing it, is it going to expand to other areas just to try to eventually see if it's possible for some of these pathogens to be going into new areas and having reservoirs in new areas just because we don't know, especially with some of the vector born, you know, with um with wildlife and or not wildlife, with livestock, agricultural animals being shipped and stuff like that. I I guess my question is is how do you control for some of the emerging viruses and trying to detect the emerging viruses and stuff like that. Like I said, I missed the full beginning of it, so this may not even be on that topic at all.",

Um I keep thinking about slide 21 from Christine's talk yesterday where she had the zootic host, the uh domestic animals and then um I guess the disease host and it was it it showed like a wildlife uh wildlife domestic and then then humans um on this this scale uh of essentially of of environmental complexity maybe. But I'm wondering if there's actually a way to develop a lab model system where you had, you know, because a lot of these things like in the environment, this is so complex, there's so many factors that we simply can't control. Is there actually a a potential model system where we say, here's a reservoir host where we can just uh have a reservoir population in a lab, we can manipulate that population, we can characterize that population. We can have a second population that can be infected by it but not necessarily uh sustain the transmission to amplify it. And then another one where maybe it's a cell culture based to say, you know, potentially causing disease. I I I I think like the the challenges in this are just huge to do to to try and understand entirely from observational data uh that we collect through whatever process, either catching mosquitoes, catching animals, uh doing uh environmental sampling. There there's so many factors here that we can't control for. Would anybody have an idea about a a potential experimental system to put into a lab? My mind is kind of drawing towards nematodes, but I actually don't know enough about viruses that affect nematodes.",

Uh so a lot of the questions that came at the discussion that came uh in when we were talking about the spillover uh is what are the drivers? What are the drivers that are making uh that these pathogens make the jump. a lot had to do with ecology of the host uh uh and uh also the human involvement. So we were talking about uh animal migration and animal density have how that affects uh this spillover effects. But one thing that uh we also talk about is how is human activities affecting this and one of examples that were discussed in the group was in influenza, how human migration into a certain areas where they are infected wild birds increases the chances of that spillover effect.

So, um from a gaps perspective, um infrastructure gaps are huge. So technologically speaking, you know, having sensors and tools to do monitoring and precision surveillance, you know, there are some tools out there already, there are some sensors coming online, but really we need to be, you know, filling some of these infrastructure gaps to develop these these necessary tools. Having the people with the necessary expertise to do the surveillance can be a challenge, especially on the scale that we realistically need to do, you know, so much surveillance for so many diverse uh pathogen systems out there. Um and then, you know, a similar concept that was discussed yesterday after the vector born disease is surveillance follows the money. Um and, you know, there's not always a lot of money in in the prevention, there's the money in the cleanup after something happens. Um and so realistically finding ways to fund um the surveillance aspects so we can prevent a problem before it even becomes an issue, um is going to be key. Um, we need to be developing novel and and newer technologies and deploying those in the field. I know there are several new technologies that are being tested right now all all around the world. Um, but really getting those up and online um sooner rather than later is is key to preventing the next, you know, big outbreak. Um, we need to be optimizing where surveillance is being conductive. Um, and and this is kind of in reference to, you know, in areas where you've got a university or you've got a big city, you tend to have a whole lot of surveillance going around in a very limited scope around those locations. But then you've got the rest of the world that maybe isn't getting nearly enough surveillance, you know, effort going into them. So are there ways we can model the best optimized surveillance networks to get the best bang for our buck. Um, we we talked about the possibility of having universal assays of pathogens that we can use in many, many different systems. So you don't have to reinvent the wheel, you can use the same assays across diverse systems, um using variable tech. Um and we also talked about the possibility of using environmental DNA techniques for the surveillance of of smaller animals and vectors, um where you maybe can't put wearable tech on a mouse or a mosquito, um but you can use DNA that's present in the environment to kind of monitor and surveil those populations. Um and and really we just talked about the gap of that communication barrier between the engineers and the biologist. So you've got a biologist who knows exactly what they want to measure, but they don't really know the engineering challenges behind how they get there. And then you have the engineers who know how to get there, but they're not entirely clear on on what the biologists are looking for. So finding a way to bridge that gap so we can make sure there's clear communication in the precision surveillance tools that we're looking for. So we had a couple of interesting ideas. Um, and one of the big ones that we talked about kind of at length was um using chemical signals to sense pathogens in the environment passively. Um, so you know, possibly using color sensor technology, um, you know, for like a vector born disease, if a mosquito deposited deposits virus on this color changing card and the card changes color, then we know that there was virus deposited there, we know there's virus in the environment. So talking about using um color changing technology to to possibly monitor uh pathogens in in the wild. Um, and and it also came up talking about nanoparticle sensors, um where we've got antibodies on these nanoparticle sensors that will change color upon detection of antigens and and you can use that in diverse systems, it's not just vector born diseases, but also in situations where you've got um more directly transmitted pathogens as well in an animal, um animal to animal contact environment. Um, and then challenges and opportunities. This left us with a lot of questions and not always a lot of answers. Um and that's because surveillance has to kind of assume a lot of different forms based on what you're looking at. So surveiling for mosquito board diseases is going to be very different from surveiling for brucelosis. And so we kind of talked about some of those differences and challenges moving forward. Um, and ultimately how does precision testing translate into action? So we can test for everything in the world, we can do all the surveillance in the world, but how do we take those data and actually put them into action and and act on them. Um, how what do you do and when do you enact some type of action after after making that surveillance. Um, realistically a big challenge is coming out with simple tools that minimize personnel requirements. Not everybody has, you know, a huge group of people who can go in and do a million PCRs and do a million identifications of mosquitoes and do a whole lot of this work. We need simple tools that can be used by anybody, possibly even a citizen science approach, um that will improve surveillance on a large scale. And then we talked about a very serious uh surveillance challenge on kind of smaller family farms that can be the source of disease because there can be barriers there where, you know, people don't want you to make that detection on their farm. It can mean something bad for their farm if you detect something in their animals. So so there's a very real challenge in uh kind of bridging those cultural barriers and even legal barriers with our our farm so we can do surveillance, but not in a way that harms anybody's livelihood. Um, so like I said, very good conversation in our group. We talked about a lot of things. I tend to think we're the best group.",
