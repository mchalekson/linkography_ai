And if we miss the temporal resolution and some of those process may happen at least within a second or a few seconds and uh for example, some people have been talking about uh FMRI functional MRI and that has been super high spatial resolution but it takes uh um really limited um uh time and also be uh confined into the space.

But as a pro person here, I like the idea of installing, you know, really high functioning synthetic probes because they have just sometimes they have better, you know, physical properties, they don't photobleach as well and we can design it to look at the longer wavelengths and multiplex in a specific way. So then it brought up to a question, can we label biomolecules of interest in a known density so that our spatial temporal imaging or, you know, interaction partner seeking that can be relevant to, you know, disease, you know, how can we, you know, design a system that is experimentally addressable? For example, if we label everything in the system is going to be super bright and it might not give you that resolution either time or space to look at the processes that you want to look at. So from the chemistry perspective, my question is, can we design a way to, you know, label the molecule that we want in a very defined density we want to target the specific temporal and spatial resolution.",

So if you're you know, if you're trying to do this on a membrane label or like you have a membrane label, it needs to be really continuous for most softwares to to fit it, but you can see in the DIC, there's like in the uh bright field, you can see the edge of the cell, you can see the nuclear envelope, uh but if you don't have a good nuclear membrane label, it's really difficult for a lot of these these softwares to to combine those two, which a person can see by eye and could potentially hand draw a million of these things, but it's really, really difficult to combine these two. So I just want to emphasize what what Josh suggested is a a really good point, I think.",

And then collecting more data than you need, that kind of goes to this computational approach as a as a potential solution and then cross the scales of biology, multimodal imaging would potentially allow you to monitor something in the seconds to minutes time scale using a very high resolution approach and then potentially shift on the minutes to hours time scale to a single cell or a single area of a tissue and then ideally whole organism kind of thing on the days to whatever time scale.",
