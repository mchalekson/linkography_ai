Um, what my lab really does is uh at the interface of instrument development, uh so we've worked on uh developing and and applying the adaptive optical lattice light sheet uh microscope in the past. Um, and we're basically working on the next generation of that to bridge together about seven different microscopes squeezed into one. So you basically have more or less um all of the the optical elements reusable or reconfigurable. Um, and then the other arm of the the lab is to develop some computational tools to be able to um mine or basically extract biologically relevant insights from these, you know, multi terabyte to almost of a quarter of a petabyte um uh projects that we've worked on in the past. So it's been maybe uh half a uh decade since we've done the first um uh adaptive optical um data set generations and we're still kind of working on mining these um these these data sets. And then the last bit is um really to demonstrate uh some of the technology that we've developed. So we apply this in a very uh specific biological context looking at cell signaling in uh 3D organoids and in zebrafish. So",

Um so I'm like kind of on the cusp of being a new investigator I guess. Um but um my research is primarily focused on um sort of like the development and application of uh intravital optical microscopy tools. So both like uh fluorescence and um as well as multiphoton like non linear scattering. So second harmonic generation and then moving towards third harmonic generation. Um and um we're kind of interested in understanding like the organel level activities. So if we can see the dynamics of cells um as they're functioning as they're activated by injury and regeneration processes um inside mostly we've been looking at the bone. Um but you know bone and muscle and other tissues. Um and um so we're working on strategies to enhance the penetration depth by moving towards like the NIR2 window um hopefully soon. Um and then uh also doing scattering correction to try to bring back our point spread function. Um as well as doing um uh some super resolution type techniques that we're heading there um to try to understand um you know get down to that organel level uh resolution um in a dynamic setting. Um was like ISM related stuff. Um and uh uh so yeah with the goal of understanding how, you know, the regenerative processes um of cells and um I guess so I guess the um for label free wise second harmonic generation, you know, is really sensitive um to collagen molecules which are very present in the bone and other tissues, cancer, etcetera and to the orientation of them. So you can both look at, you know, the organization of collagen features. Um just strictly speaking it also a polarization component that can be used uh potentially, although it's more challenging in scattering tissues. Um and then third harmonic is primarily sensitive to refractive index, nice little things as well as like size and shape but but predominantly refractive index. Um and um I guess we have another branch that also is doing a little bit of uh phase related imaging um uh trying to look at forgraphy to understand uh bone stem cells and how they grow and can be expanded and used as a therapeutic and how they respond to challenge. So um I guess uh Alex.",

For example, the um you know, we can make very small tag so that we can label small molecules and that way we can uh enhance the sensitivity and also the specificity of small molecule detection. Uh another approach we uh worked on is to increase the multiplexity. So I think uh we just mentioned that Rama, I mean fluorescence can only limited to uh seven just just mentioned uh fluorescence typically limited to four colors. But Rama can go significantly beyond that uh but because of the linewidth. So we engineered uh Raman probes that has very very sharp lines and then we make them uh all resolve from each other. So we can have a library of well resolved Raman uh probes then we can image them uh simultaneously. So the current uh we can we can go up to like 20 colors at the same time. So that's something I think Rama can really go beyond fluorescence. Again, because of the new probes we introduced.",

But microscopy often offer higher resolution. So that's something that there's nothing to validate about because this is this is exactly why we do this, right? So if everything can be validated by other techniques, there's no benefit of doing this anymore. So so you can you can validate about some of the aspects, maybe, you know, ensemble or some basic level, but there's definitely something that I I believe something that cannot be validated by any other thing.

So we use the um we get the really high high resolution uh essentially profile of the sample and if you and phase is supposed to give you the optical path delay as it travels to the sample, right? As the light travels to the sample.

So essentially we're reporting the number of chemical bonds in the sample. So that's what we can report.

Because uh because the the light sheet just because the configuration of the objectives, we use lower NA objectives than um than typical confocal microscopes, right? So you would better, you know, be able to get better lateral resolution with like a spinning disc confocal or something like that, but it's not very amenable to do uh time lapse three-dimensional volumetric imaging whereas the light sheet is, right? So it really is again, I I'm always of the view that, you know, best tool for the the question at hand. So if your question is um related to dynamics, um it's hard to kind of get to a a point where you can do volumetric imaging with the canonical like gold standard microscopes that most you know, biology labs or core facilities at the moment have, right?",
