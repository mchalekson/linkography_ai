So the first way to think about it is how can we gate these multiple scattering? How can we reject them so that we can only get ballistic photons that carry the truly valuable information. And then a second direction, a second perspective on this is how do we use multiple scattering to get more information? Because these ballistic photons decay exponentially as you go deeper into the tissue.",

So I always keep an eye on what's happening in the smaller scale higher resolution and to see what can be translatable to animal. So my research is ranging from cancer to neurological imaging and lipidomics to metabolomics and also cancer and also includes physiological intervention and also bone sodium content and ex nuclei and phosphorus all types of imaging, but I really like to make the link between the lab to the from bench to bedside actually.",

Um and so especially now we push to multiphoton, two, three, I don't know, can we do four or five? Like at what level does that get so complicated and so expensive that it's not really it's not really useful. And so I I would really like to I think my background is is in more of the second thinking more about the second part of this question, but I think what intrigues me about this room is thinking about the two of these together, especially because super resolution microscopy I think is often speaking as somebody who's not well trained in that area, but seems to me to be very photon start in general, like you need a lot of light. Um and so if you're saying, okay, well I'm going to throw out all the scattered photons, you're walking a you know, that line is going to get hard to walk pretty quickly. So I I think that I really like the thinking about how how can we maybe take these two together and I'm not I haven't seen too much looking at super resolution combined with thinking deeper in tissue and how to think about scattering. And the last thing I'll say just to uh is I also wonder what the room is for conversations in between let's say minimally invasive types of technology as a stepping stone to getting to the ultimate goal where we just shine some light outside the body and then capture everything outside the body non invasively, but maybe minimally invasive with um, you know, fibers, fiber bundles, uh these kind of things can be a a nice stepping stone to push things into the into practice because I think with biomedical imaging outside of the like really big success of OCT, there is not so many optical like biomedical optical techniques that have really made a significant um, you know, push into the clinic.",

So there is something um I was thinking about. Uh, I was doing uh uh super resolution when I was doing super resolution microscope, I always wanted to stabilize the sample so that with a with a long uh long-term imaging, for example, like 30 minutes, I don't get a great uh sample drift. So one way I was thinking while I was a post talk is to use the scattering light from the cell. So we take uh we take the scattering light uh the image using scattering light of the cell at at the beginning of the imaging and after a few minutes, we take another one. So by the end, like by the end of the imaging, we could use those image to align um kind of put to the kind of uh correct the drift. So that's one thing I was thinking about. Uh, but I haven't tested and I'm not sure how precise we can do as my uh uh I claim it 10 nanometer uh uh uh precision. So I'm trying to make sure how I can how precisely I can do that. And uh some thoughts for the first uh question like how can super resolution uh methods can be translated to uh uh organismal applications. Um, I have been thinking about that for the past few years. Um, one thing I found uh uh that could be helpful is maybe uh stabilizing the floor for chemistry because right now uh I put a lot of time on doing uh imaging analysis uh like look at all the localizations and how to cluster them, how to figure out the organization of the proteins. But at the end of the day, I thought if we could use different floor force to map these what I mean is if I put it in a example, see if we have a DNA molecule, they can uh kind of fold into different structure. Like if we wanted to figure out the structure, let's see uh we can use uh maybe the barcoding system, like we can since we know the sequence, we probably can uh use the barcoding to map the entire sequence, then then we label that molecule uh on cells, then we can image that. Maybe we know, we would figure out like uh how they position the spatial. So that's So I think um maybe uh aside from the imaging processing just using AI or deep learning to look at the clusters or organizations, maybe uh uh floor for might be helpful on that. That was my thought.",

And if you do that in an animal, it would be too much data. We don't have big enough computers for that. And so this is a very interesting, you know, concept because when we want to look at an animal, we just cut off a piece of our zebra fish and take that tissue and we call that an animal or an organism. Um, but I I think this is a very interesting conversation, but what will we do with that data if we got super res from an entire animal. Like I'm not even sure what we do with it. And that's what I'm actually scared about that part. I guess when we have a single cell, we're we're also doing expansion microscopy and we're doing structural elimination or single molecule imaging on top of that. And I'm calculating resolution and it's scaring me already.",

And so every optical system you pick up whether it's your iPhone or a microscope is designed to throw that information out. And that's the that I think is the kernel of the revolutionary idea here is like let's remove that constraint and go back to the drawing board and think differently. And so that I think that that's one thing. The other thing I was thinking about related to this conversation of so much data and resolution is you need the resolution but not everywhere. And maybe we don't need the super resolution at all points. So you can think at a native structure like I want to try to have, you know, again as optical designers, conventionally, we think about isotropic resolution everywhere. But in a more if we remove that constraint and think about, well maybe I just care about super resolution here and here and here and here in these specific parts of the cell and everywhere else, I don't care. It's fine if I have millimeter resolution maybe. I just want to be able to zoom into these certain areas. And so maybe there's I think if we think about more interesting ways to we have a limited number of pixels or voxels or bits or however you want to whatever fundamental quanta of information you want to think about that we can distribute along our in our sample. And so can we think about innovative ways to redistribute that in a in a way that's efficient but maybe isn't, you know, interpretable without a algorithm to understand or reconstruct or give us some meaningful information about what's going on.",

So let's think of DOT diffuse optical tomography and people sort of um uh there's there's actually a colleague here at Washu who builds the whole brain uh uh imaging device, right? And and looks at uh sort of function uh um by collecting diffuse light off of there. So maybe um maybe uh a regime of pushing the resolution there might be helpful. Uh, right now it's sort of spatially resolved based upon the average number of scattering events. It takes light longer to travel further or or uh uh and and you can sort of resolve some things in depth that way. So maybe that's one way we can think about it. I think maybe another question is um like if we take our existing technologies that can penetrate deep but somehow are deficient in some other axis. So let's just say pet for example, right? The gold standard in in specifically detecting something uh um within within the body and organism. Uh, is there something that optical imaging if engineered the right way, maybe with the the fancy uh fluorescent based reporters that we saw uh earlier in the keynote. Um, maybe there's something that we can do to to to solve a more targeted problem as a as a as a as a prototype for for for uh for solving the the bigger question that that was posed.

So I was, I forgot this person's name, but I was talking to another person in the breakout session that they were developing this low field MRI where they can be portable as a probe, right? So imagine, uh, you are doing, uh, clinic session and you have this probe with MRI and then you're doing this scanning and then when you have a suspicious area, you heard a beep from the AI algorithms and then you have a needle that comes out that gives you the optical fiber and then insert into do kind of do a real time at a point of procedure diagnosis.

Um and then using um we developed a confocal microscope that also would go into the oral cavity and we design our own miniature lens that's about um less than a centimeter in diameter. So it's relatively small can fit inside. Um and there you're doing kind of that point measurement but it's with imaging looking at um cell nuclei um that have been identified based on the metabolic changes in the tissue um using the fluorescence lifetime. There's one other group that also uses distortion in the lens so that um on it captures a larger field of view that has a worse resolution, but at the center it has better resolution um but a very limited field of view so that you could use it to kind of guide around um and then you if you see something at the edge of the focus then you move it to the center and you get that higher resolution in the center. So there's just a couple ideas of some and then one thing that I I didn't really hear uh being brought up but photoacoustic imaging for increased depth um we didn't really discuss but for that kind of multimodality and and using a different type of excitation for your in comparison to your detection.",
