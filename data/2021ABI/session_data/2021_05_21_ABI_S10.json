I've been there for about three years now. And my lab is a cell biology lab. We do a lot of imaging and uh we ask the questions of how local signaling dynamics result in cell shape changes during cell migration. We do that in individually migrating cells and in collectively migrating cells. So there's this scale issue of of molecular organelles and cells and super cellular structures where we try to to bridge those different domains by using different modes of microscopy. So my lab relies a lot of on on on live cell imaging and I think uh for us it's a bottleneck to to do quantitative uh imaging. We do like cell edge tracking, cell tracking but but we would like to have better ways and faster ways of developing um analysis modalities that suit our questions and it's they're always changing so so one needs to adapt these um algorithms quickly and that's something that I'm hoping to to discuss more uh in this group.",

Um, that can be quantified uh so that it can become a testable hypothesis and that, you know, ultimately our images are just a uh our data is just a way to actually get at the underlying phenomenon and and how it is changing over time or what have you.

And I think that's a pretty big bottleneck for quantitative imaging because I got to be honest and I think the answer is a resounding no for 90% of the cases. And I think that that's kind of sad, but like that's that's the truth, right? Like somebody has a little special trick there or a little trick there that they process it with and it's not always available. And I find that that that limits a lot of progress because it doesn't allow us to really standardize things across different institutions or instruments or setups and so I've seen some databases go up that try to provide that information. I've participated in some of them as well to just give away everything, all the metadata, all the code, everything you have to try to make it transferable, but I I don't know to me that's the bottleneck to doing really quantitative imaging.",

Um, so I wanted to maybe propose something to uh to to sort of um come off of of David's um points from earlier as a as a possible solution, but I don't know how to solve it. So, you know, um, we typically try to harmonize data sets in the measurement space because that's quantitative. Uh, we kind of know how to think about photons or how to think about um uh, you know, magnetic fields or spins or you know, the things that that our instruments are designed to measure. Uh, but this this concept of a latent space or a low dimensional embedding that David talked about is kind of um interesting because honestly we're all imaging some some biological or chemical phenomena that that exists in some other space than the measurements that we've made. If you could figure out how to do this mapping, then you've got actually, you know, an object, a unique object that exists uh in its own space. It's defined by its chemical properties, it's it's it's it's biological state or what have you. And then the instrument is simply a mapping to to the to the data that you collect. And I'm just wondering um you know, what what possibilities are there for us to start learning what this common space might be or expressions of it so that we can um start uh, you know, making these things these comparisons more easy to to do on a routine basis. Um, so just just an idea.",

Um, one one big elephant in the room is that or or rather the reasons why I feel like, you know, we still have these problems and we haven't been able to solve them given that the EM field has been able to do that, the medical imaging community has been able to do that is when we're looking at cells at either the cellular scale or the subcellular scale, the diversity um is is vast. Um, both in the context of the probes that you're using to to measure the responses like fluorescent proteins or or the conjugations of dyes, um, the expression levels can be different. Um, so so that makes it difficult to make it quantitative because you can take an image of mitochondria, uh, protein expression in one lab and try to draw the same conclusions than a different lab, it makes no sense, right? Because context is lacking. Um, the other thing the other comment related to um to the the data formats, like why is it so difficult for us to share data? Um, obviously the the context is is the eluding part, but more the data formats are also kind of the the issue. At the moment, um, I I again, I've been thinking about this problem for a while, right? Because the types of data sets that we kind of uh generate are usually, you know, a lot more problematic to transmit to other folks, even though we put them in Google buckets and things like that, they're like usually like a two terabyte limit in terms of like transfer per day or something like that. Uh, but more importantly like the the format, like why is it that we have not all conformed to a given format. Um, and the reason is we have all different requirements because the imaging um that one lab does uh could be in two dimensions, even if dynamics is just, you know, basically like a few megabytes to maybe a couple gigabytes. Um, if you're doing volumetric imaging that kind of explodes and if you're doing, you know, volumetric time series that kind of, you know, blows up even more. Now, for us, the main requirement has always been the ability to do parallel reads and parallel writes on some of these um computations to be able to kind of really kind of scale it with the computational resources one has, right? That may not always be the requirement, but that kind of severely limits the formats um that that one has access to. And of course, you know, there's this huge kind of uh balance between pros and cons as to the different file formats that allow for or that basically kind of um prevent some of the features. Um, so yeah, I mean, just general broad thoughts on on a few of the points that we were discussing.",

Um, you know, something that's has tried to take off in in neuroscience or at least the world of neuroscience I'm in where people are recording neural activity from animals or humans and and it's oftentimes really hard to get that data. It's very, you know, challenging and so people want to be able to share and have lots of people use and there's sort of a transition now to try and have things in a common data format and have it open that people can share, but I think there is largely a resistance for this to be widely adopted because as it requires a lot of work from every individual lab because it isn't built in uh by the the corporations that produce various microscopes or electrode arrays and and so forth. So there's not a lot of uh it's not a lot of motivation for people to end up doing this. And it really is a lot of work from an individual scientist to take their data set and make it easy for others to use. And so I I think I I like the idea of having what David brought up and that you, you know, if you have the basic metadata that you need and maybe take some responsible notes as you're collecting data that you can at least put it into a common embedding space uh so that you can try and uh interpret what data can connect to what. Uh, I don't know if that's the solution for my particular field or what, but I've noticed this has been an issue, like more of a sociological issue of of people not all getting on board and maybe the DICOM uh situation where you effectively have the hardware manufacturers, the corporate overlords agreeing to have common formats kind of forces everyone into that world and and maybe that's a a good way to go.",
