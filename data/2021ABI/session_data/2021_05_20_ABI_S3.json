Uh I really like the second question, how can we mitigate or utilize multiple scattering when we transition this technique to invivo applications? I think there are two ways to think about it. So if we are talking about like traditional super resolution techniques like in optics, uh multiple scattering is the enemy because they scramble your light. So the first way to think about it is how can we gate these multiple scattering? How can we reject them so that we can only get ballistic photons that carry the truly valuable information. And then so I guess one direction along this way is to think how can we more efficiently uh select these ballistic photons. And then a second direction, a second perspective on this is how do we use multiple scattering to get more information? Because these ballistic photons decay exponentially as you go deeper into the tissue. Uh so if we can use the but multiple scattering uh process looks random, but it's deterministic. So if we have physics model that can take advantage of this uh interference and use that to our advantage because with multiple scattering, you can actually get more angles, right? So with that you get more field of view, you get more uh uh resolution. So uh I I think that part is pretty interesting.",

And so I really resonated with what we were just talking about about the second option, which I think is the much better one, maybe unbiased, but uh to try to harness the multiply scattered photons and in some sense redeem those to make them make them useful for our for our optical imaging techniques. Uh the last thing I'll say is just that as an engineer, I'm a tool builder by nature and so I'm really looking forward to meeting all of you and hearing about Kristen what you said in the main session really resonated with me too. How can I bring engineering skills to bear to solve solve problems? So thanks.",

So I always keep an eye on what's happening in the smaller scale higher super resolution and to see what can be translatable to animal.

So there is something um I was thinking about. Uh, I was doing uh uh super resolution when I was doing super resolution microscope, I always wanted to stabilize the sample so that with a with a long uh long-term imaging for example like 30 minutes, I don't get a great uh sample drift. So one way I was thinking while I was a postdoc is to use the scattering light from the cell. So we take uh we take the scattering light the image using scattering light of the cell at at the beginning of the imaging and after a few minutes we take another one. So by the end like by the end of the imaging we could use those image to align um kind of put to the kind of uh correct the drift. So that's one thing I was thinking about. Uh, but I haven't tapped it. I'm not sure how precisely I can do as my uh uh I claim a 10 nanometer uh uh uh precision. So I'm trying to make sure how I can how precisely I can do that. And uh some thoughts for the first uh question like how can super resolution uh methods can be translated to uh uh organismal applications. Um, I have been thinking about that for the past few years. Um, one thing I found uh uh that could be helpful is maybe lizing the floor for chemistry because right now uh I spend a lot of time on doing uh imaging analysis uh like look at all the localization and how to cluster them and how to figure out the organization of the proteins. But uh at the end of the day I thought if we could use different floor for to map these what I mean is if I put it in a example, see if we have a DNA molecule, they can uh kind of fold into different structure. Like if we wanted to figure out the structure, let's see uh we can use uh maybe the barcoding system like we can since we know the sequence we probably can uh use the barcoding to map the entire sequence, then then we label that the molecule uh ourselves, then we can image that maybe we know we would figure out like uh how they position the spatial. So that's So I think um maybe uh aside from the imaging processing just using AI or deep learning to look at the cluster or organization, maybe uh uh floor for can might be helpful.

So I think you did made a great point about the uh the the sort of the paradigm of of at least microscopy uh and ballistic imaging that we throw away all the scattered light. Then we're kind of forgetting our friends in the diffuse optics regime. So let's think of DOT diffuse optical tomography and people sort of um uh there's there's actually a colleague here at Washu who builds the whole brain uh uh imaging uh device, right? And and looks at uh sort of function uh um by collecting diffuse light off of there. So maybe um maybe a a regime of pushing the resolution there might be helpful. Uh right now it's sort of spatially resolved based upon the average number of scattering events that takes light longer to travel further or or uh uh and and you can sort of resolve some things in depth that way. So maybe that's one way we can think about it. I think maybe another question is um like if we take our existing technologies that can penetrate deep but somehow are deficient in some other axis. So let's just say pet for example, right? The gold standard in in specifically detecting something uh uh within within the body and an organism. Uh is there something that optical imaging if engineered the right way, maybe with the the fancy uh fluorescent based reporters that we saw uh earlier in the keynote. Um maybe there's something that we can do to to to solve a more targeted problem as a as a as a prototype for for for uh for solving the the bigger question that that was posed. Um just a couple ideas there.",

It's what's commercially available, it's what we can order. We're not going to build our own lenses. And that is why we use them. There's no one has come up with a better way that I can purchase to do this and it's very limiting because the high NA is usually uh uh for the most of our of our work for super res which is single molecule or structured light. Um and I generally put those in just two categories. I know that some of you are have four categories of super res.

How do we how will we get a super resolution image of entire mouse, for example, uh uh while the mouse is still alive. So, um this is a really important question and um my group and I we have thought a lot about this and how can we overcome this and how can we find a method that would allow us to to give us something reasonable and the best we came up with is, well, we probably cannot do live imaging.",

Like if we're in the fluorescence and uh some of the light from your floor for gets multiply scattered, there's kind of two ways that we might think of detecting it. One is just waiting long enough because those multiply scattered photons will take longer to get to you. So you you kind of wait long enough and see where they landed and maybe those were your scattered photons. The other thing that I think Josh is really better expert at is um if you change your imaging instrument in some way because that light was determinate that scattering was deterministic, like the cell boundaries that the light scattered off of were at certain some place relative to your imaging system. If you change the instrument a little bit to better leverage those scattering patterns and get more light out now and get more light in, then you have a signature for for for fixing your image in the bit. So the the the the imaging problem becomes harder now because it's no longer uh uh optically engineered perfect objective that does your job for you. Now you've got to reoptimize the imaging system on the fly for your specific sample and then you got to make sure that whatever you thought the scattering was from wherever it was from and whenever it was from like that's actually what you're detecting because it in principle at least with elastically scattered light, there's no way to identify it any other way. Like the photon energy is going to be the same, right? And uh and so yeah.",

Um, so that I think is something else too that you make your you make your your enemy your friend in some sense by, you know, taking advantage of what's happening there and then maybe you maybe you decouple from the traditional connection with lenses between field of view and working depth and NA and the geometrical piece of lens design, there's only so many parameters you have to to tweak, but if you can think about your lens as a and I think Sian will be, you know, with Laura, she always talks about like your lens is a Laura Waller, your lens is a matrix basically, which I love that like picture thinking about um, you know, and in the wavefront shaping community, we think of like replacing a lens with a cube of salt or something like, you know, cube of sugar or something and just sending light through it and if you know what the you know, the matrix is, mathematically there may be some interesting properties there that you can leverage that may actually help you and not hurt you.",

Um, so to solve the problem, I think we can start from two. Uh one is detection, how can you reassign photons based on different properties, based on different characteristics of photons you capture and then how can you reassign it. And then second way is uh second way, how can you form the beam for for example, for light sheet microscopy, it's very hard to get a nice light sheet after scattering. So how can you use wavefront engineering or scattering compensation to get a nice illumination in the beginning. So you don't worry that much about detection later. Um, my question is um like what is the fundamental limit in either direction. So if we try all these methods and we push our depths like 10% more, is it worth it? Uh, and this applies for both um detection and illumination. Detection, you have photo photon starvation, you have noise issue and for illumination, um no matter how much you compensate, at some point you lose the correlation between photons and you lost uh at one point it's just random walk. So how much more can we push and what is the fundamental challenge in the in the field right now.",

So I was I forgot this person's name, but I was talking to another person in the breakout session that they were developing this low field MRI where they can be portable as a probe, right? So imagine uh you are doing uh clinic session and you have this probe with MRI and you're doing this scanning and then when you have a suspicious area, you heard a beep from the AI algorithms and then you have a needle that comes out that gives you the optical fiber and then insert into do kind of do a real time at a point of procedure diagnosis.

Um and then using um we developed a confocal microscope that also would go into the world cavity and we design our own miniature lens that's about um less than a centimeter in diameter. So it's relatively small, can fit inside. Um and there you're doing kind of that point measurement, but it's with imaging looking at um cell nuclei um that have been identified based on the metabolic changes in the tissue um using the fluorescence lifetime. There's one other group that also uses distortion in the lens so that um on it captures a larger field of view that has a worse resolution, but at the center it has better resolution um but a very limited field of view so that you could use it to kind of guide around um and then you if you see something at the edge of the focus then you move it to the center and you get that higher resolution in the center. So there's just a couple ideas of some and then one thing that I I didn't really hear being brought up but photoacoustic imaging for increased depth um we didn't really discuss but for that kind of multimodality and and using a different type of excitation through your in comparison to your detection.",

Um so that would be one thought. I think it's hard because of the the topics are relatively broad actually even though you know, in some ways they're specific, but they're relatively broad and you can approach them in different ways and so it's um it's almost hard to put your ideas into, you know, kind of groups. You know, and when I was looking at this topic I was thinking we could talk about new applications for super resolution that are, you know, it's not currently applied to. We could talk about different um advances to the implementation and then um I was also I was glad to see that there were people from MRI in here that if we could um get some information from other fields in imaging that might influence our approaches. Um but I do feel that each person had something different to add that um it might have been hard to kind of narrow down the topics because they are um there's so much to cover. I think. But I hope that you continue to have your discussions with each other in the different um gather rooms or towns or without you get to be in um so you can continue these uh conversations.",
