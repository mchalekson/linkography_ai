And I also I have worked in the past on spec reconstruction, iterative reconstruction with motion correction and also novel MPG sorry multipinol geometries and stuff like that. So I the just relevant to this topic what I'm kind of interested right now I would be interested is to have a iterative reconstruction method for phase contrast with the raw interferometric data. So as you know that phase contrast you have to derive so from the projections you have to derive the you know the attenuation image, the phase image and the scatter image and then you reconstruct and so if I could do it from the raw interference patterns it's very challenging because of the very computational requirements. Okay it's very high computational requirements. And I'm also interested in deep learning methods for that like for some of these reconstruction methods. And also I think that will help our phase contrast in in correcting some of the errors due to large you know grating artifacts. So you know like it can learn a lot of things that ordinary reconstruction methods would not. And as for just a quick addition that no that's okay yeah I think that's enough.",

So, uh I think this is a combination of the optical and acoustic for the acoustic photo acoustic imaging.

Only solution I'm seeing is you can do the differential contrast easily, but you have to generate the differential contrast. In some problems the contrast occurs like in brain imaging, you're doing a task and or or you could you could be like doing something and there is a natural contrast in blood volume change, right? There is that's happening. But all problems don't lend to those contrast. So how do you how do you tackle this problem, right?",

For example, if you want to image a cell, then it depends on how many nanoparticles basically gets into the cells. So it define basically the resolution. But the other interesting aspect about nanoparticles is that the validity of the like the signal is okay, but it's not it it may not correspond with like what you're looking for. For example, we label like some cells with iron oxide nanoparticles and that cells we basically um put the reporter gene to basically activate that with luciferase. So we can also get a bioluminescence image of the of the cells that we inject them. So what happens was that even though when the cells are dead, you get the signal from oxide nanoparticles for like a few days. So when using nanoparticles, you can increase concentration, but at the same time you need to make sure that it's safe and you need to make sure that they don't affect the like the functionality of the cells or like activate some like uh I don't know something like apoptotic like pathways there. So for nanoparticles, I would say we always need another modality just to make sure that what we see is real.",

A lot of MRI right now is basically anatomic so that stroke is one where there's like functional data coming from the diffusion, but um the rest of them are mostly anatomy. So lumbar spine MRIs to look for whether or not there's a narrowed narrow frame where the nerve is coming out to say that's why this person's having, you know, pain.

So you can't use one modality for all types of diseases you will end up and that's obvious. And for example, you lung imaging with MRI without using hyperpolarize it is it is really difficult and but you can get very well x-rays and CTs from for lung imaging. So that is my main problem. So it is disease specific. And the second thing if what what I would like to do is most likely to increase the accuracy accuracy because MRI, I'm an MRI physicist, multi contrast, flexible contrast acquisition. So you can tailor the spins depending on however you want and generate the different contrast for different parameters. So you do have million parameters and it all affects the contrast. So that you can tailor the acquisition for lung imaging, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's going to be very better than x-ray. It can come close enough, maybe. Uh, but that is the limitation. We all know that. So that is most likely I might contribute to this question in a way that I can accelerate and the acquisition and increase the accuracy of the findings.",

It's it takes advantage of just the host of light based technologies we have available and we wouldn't have biomedical research without that. So how do you connect these clinically accessible imaging modalities like MRI where you can't see anything. You can see structures, you can tag a few things, maybe some spectroscopy, but compared to what light can do, it's just the the tiniest scratch, um, mechanistically speaking. So how do you relate those two imaging modalities to get the maximum value from an a a research and analytical modality and a more clinically accessible or clinically relevant modality. I think for me that's that's always been my sort of challenge, uh, coming up as was trained as a as a biologist and then went into biophysics. How do you connect those two things?",
