But the challenge there is again, I'm thinking from like the bias of tracking individual proteins, um this relies on sparse labeling. So you're labeling maybe 1% of the proteins that you're tracking. Um and then you label 1% of one protein in red and 1% of another protein in green, even if they're interacting, how do you really know they're interacting if you only label 1% of each um population.",

It's not particle tracking per se. It's more just trying to get a, you know, like a metabolic view of the cell. And with the Raman stuff, we've got a group that's working on surface enhanced Raman probes, which I think could potentially be tagged to to molecules. But what we've like it's just I I'd interested if anybody's actually gone further with Raman. We can't get around the integration time. So to study fast things, we just have to integrate for so long that it's not really a particle tracking thing. It might be more of a a cell migration type time scale on the minutes kind of time scale, but on this the second particle tracking in a cell type stuff, we haven't we haven't been able to do it. We we can characterize lipids and and DNA and things like that and mitochondria produce a pretty strong Raman signal.",

I think that's a very kind of simple thing that we we could do with a lot of the particles that we've already tracked and measured is to just say like, you know, what constraints must be imposed to slow this thing down to the observed rate.
