Uh to to study uh the cell skeleton. And so my my lab we kind of took that interest in in the cell skeleton to ask a very simple question. How does a heart grow on a single cell level? Meaning how does a single heart muscle cell physically get bigger? And that is one of the main drivers of our lab. Uh and we do attack that in multiple ways and it occurred to us a few years ago, actually about a year ago now that we could use the same technologies we're using to start mimicking what's happening inside of patients in in a in a uh basically a dish. And so we are now developing uh systems to mimic ischemia and reperfusion injury in our cardiac myos and that's allowed us to start doing screening and I have no idea what I'm doing and it's phenomenal. I have we're having a very good time. Uh and so we are kind of all over the place. We're we're looking at individual sarcomeres and we're looking to find some drugs.",

So I'm very interesting this session uh the reason I've never done anything like image guided therapies before, but uh I'm very curious how can I contribute? How can I use label free imaging, how can I use optics and algorithms to enable point of procedure diagnosis uh or point of procedure real time monitoring of the therapeutic process. Uh, what role would a resolution of cellular dynamics mean in the in the process of imaging guided therapies.",

Uh, totally different issues when you start injecting something in the body, whether it's a mouse, a rat or or human. Well, you can't inject in the human before you inject in the mouse and the rat but anyway, so the big issue is how do you how do you get something somewhere where it needs to go? What are the biological barriers that needs to be overcome? Uh, and the biggest question, I guess, you all know that it takes about 10 years to get something from the bench to to being somewhat approved. Not even fully approved, but somewhat approved. 10 years, uh, tens of millions, sometimes hundred millions of dollars. Just just something has to something has to be done about that.

Um we got all kinds of interesting data in addition that I went to go validate with some metabolic imaging, just nothing alike. Not even slightly. And so then we just did all the experiments over again and it told a completely different story. It turned out that, you know, sitting in millimolar glucose, which is what you have to do for the cells to survive, completely wrecked their metabolism in terms of you know, what we're looking for. So it is really easy to get to be misled by those tools. I'm not saying they're bad, but it's very easy to get misled because then you think they're real, but something that's required for the culture conditions um ruins everything. And for someone who works in neuroimmunity, like the microglia that I focus on, they know when they're in culture. They know when they're being looked at and they change their their gene transcription. So those things have been have been very frustrating for for my personal kind of work. Now, they may work in other systems, but they they've never worked for me.",

And so, um in my group, um you know, we've been interested in in uh well there's quite a there's quite a lot of efforts out there that are along these lines, especially the nanoparticle community, which can label, you know, things with both therapeutics and diagnostics. My group is stuck on the concept of uh reporter genes. And because GFP's been so critical to, you know, microscopy and biomedical applications and and study, you know, if we could develop good reporter genes for in vivo and human applications, that seems critically important to look at like living drug therapies. So cells that are being regenerative medicine for your cardiac myocytes or um you know, uh car T cells are a modern example, um virally delivered vectors another another example. And so, you know, to me on that front, if you can if you can image the delivery of these types of therapeutics that have different PK because they are tend to um sense and respond to pathology, that makes it a totally different problem than just what the admin characteristics are of a of uh chemotherapy or a biologic.

They have like different properties and all of those things needs also to be considered in the in vitro setting. Like with the advances in the 3D bioprinting and like making like um uh pattern substrates that can basically provide opportunity for cells to basically make a 3D structures rather than like the flat surface uh 2D structured, all of those can be of a great help for getting more meaningful and robust in vitro data. So I think for that purpose maybe a group of scientists that have different looks into the same problem needs to collaborate to each other to basically make a perfect in vitro like setting that can be more close to the in vivo part.",
