So it's a catalysis theme and I interpret this personally, you can interpret however you want, um as you know, the of the many ways that we're going to have to, you know, do chemical transformations related to negative emissions. Um are there elements that cut across and that are challenges no matter what? Um are there elements where you would want to go one way versus another way? Um and so, you know, you have some if you read the breakout, there's some questions there uh that serve as prompts also for you to think about.

So selectivity, stability, um and and durability. Um and whether that's for photocatalyst, thermocatalyst or electrocatalyst, that's really what ultimately defines whether something's going to be successful or not. And then I think depending upon the way the driving force is delivered, um be it sunlight photo, um be it, you know, thermo so heat, uh be it electro, so, you know, potential, that determines sort of the way the catalyst can be used, so the way it's structured, think about reactor design, right? There's ways you design reactors for thermocatalysts that you couldn't really design for so easily for say photocatalysts, right? Um, and once you start getting into sort of the design or how these materials can be used, that's when transport starts to play a significant role in terms of sort of driving this along. So I I tend to think that you know, there might be a generalized theme um across these different driving forces and if you build from the catalyst and sort of build from catalyst to implementation.

So like a hydrogen, you can speed up the relative rate of a hydrogenation to a CC bond cleavage that wouldn't directly be influenced by the the potential or maybe only in a very kind of indirect way by the field or something. Um so so you can definitely get selectivity enhancements but then there's there's trade offs with that because then you can get like parasitic hydrogen evolution instead of the the hydrogenation you're trying to carry out. So there's there's pros and cons and then the question is like can I design the catalyst to have a high enough faradaic efficiency uh you know, to still make the electrochemical pathway favorable.",

Some most of the times I was like, Simona, we can, you're going to violate the second level of thermodynamics. I was like, yes, because it's just an open system. So as soon as the product is formed, you're going to separate so you're going to push more the production of the second product. So for example, I'm working on a hydrogen production, sure, starting from hydrocarbon, sure. And so we have some um reaction that are thermodynamic constraint as you know, water gas shift reaction or meeting steam reforming reaction. Sure, they're coming from fossil fuel but could be any kind of other hydrocarbon. And as soon as the reaction is taking place, you're going to form CO2 and hydrogen. Hydrogen is separated. So the reaction is moved forwards to more you know, um react react products formation. And so you can create two streams at the end, one that is pure hydrogen and the second one that is pure CO2 and with CO2 you can do whatever you want because because it's also at high pressure. So designing a catalyst, yes, but I believe is not the designing of the catalyst. We have also to think about the overall box and say, okay, we can do something more on that one because I was thinking, okay, I can improve, I can improve like you know, the efficiency of the catalyst, okay, bigger surface area, how can I spread out, you know, we have always the same material and how can I spread out all the active catalyst on that material, it's amazing.

Um when you have a really deeply endothermic reaction um so like water splitting if you just did thermolysis, it's an impractically high temperature but you can break it into multiple reactions uh at lower temperatures for various trade offs. So it's second design principle to push you maybe uh to out of the box to think in terms of is how do you sort of split one reaction that might be really hard sometimes into multiple reactions that are easier and can be manipulated uh differently and also get your separations like uh splitting water, the oxygen and hydrogen happening in two different reactions.

That's just, you know, and you know, applied work, right? Uh, what you know, it's coming out here is that there's a there are fundamental drivers in uh thinking about the environment and what you do with the environment can manipulate the kinetics or even the thermodynamics depending on what you do and that's where the separation topic is, but there's a theme of environment uh consider more broadly than uh just the catalyst.

What's the ranges and how should I, you know, vary them, right? Because it should be unbiased hopefully in the way you're doing it. That's one side of it. The other side that I've been interested in with more some work I've been doing in um paralysis with some people at Cornell was, you know, in all these systems and and this these systems as well is you don't have one simple reaction, right? You have multiple different reactions occurring, um side reactions, who knows what's going on in your system. Is there ways that we can look at a surrogate or some sort of exemplar reaction or part of the reactions and use data to get something out of that, right? So if we have a lot of unknowns, we have a lot of things going on, are there ways to identify some critical aspects that you can can kind of focus on and maybe make progress that way, which I don't have a good answer to yet, but the idea of using, you know, machine learning and AI and data mining to do that, I think is interesting for for this problem and for like the broader class of problems.",

So for a long time chemical engineers when they're talking about scaling processes have thought about varying dimensionless groups that describe um dominating processes in different length scales and in different regimes, right? And it it's really useful to Simona's point about design of experiment, right? Because you know, if you have a hypothesis about what's going on, you can make scaling arguments to say, well, if this process was going on, this is about the rate I think it would be happening or this is the likelihood of this process occurring. Um so some of that I think already exists, it just would be useful to apply um um to these newer kinds of problems.

This kind of goes to Adam's one of Adam's first points about what reactions to do electrochemically versus thermochemically, right? And so I think often times we we sometimes get ourselves confused and it could also be sort of how we sit within the innovation spectrum. Um, these things are often thought of as an either or and not an and, right?

Um, how feasible it is to design true model systems that you could characterize kind of traditionally and you know, correlate to theory to get some type of rational um, you know, design rules for systems like that. I I think it's a that's a type of thinking that's very appealing to chemists because we want to rationally understand everything at a molecular level, but in a lot of systems a true molecular system isn't going to even be um feasible and whatever design principles you design you can derive from a small molecule catalyst isn't really going to be applicable. Um, so for systems like that, you know, is a is it a case where there needs to be some type of bridging between synthesis where you're synthesizing perhaps slightly cleaner systems but are still still reasonably complex and from the actual experimental and characterization side where you can get down and probe what's going on at much more well-defined species within those complex architectures.

We're trying to move away from you know, coal fired or or whatever process we're using to get to the electricity. So say you start with electricity, the question is then should I pump that directly into a process or could I turn that into heat and use heat? And the the Praveen asked for something articulate. I'm I'm going to be very inarticulate because I haven't completely thought this through but but you know, you can always turn the electricity into heat for basically unit efficiency. Um, I think in some cases if you're not trying to drive against too large of a gradient that the electricity might be most effectively used for pumping heat because you can do that at higher efficiency than just turning it directly into heat, but then there's some auxiliary hardware and and maybe, you know, the actual don't work out.

And Professor Wilcox most of the time gives a book that is called Alchemy Alchemy of Air that talks about ammonia production. And so there was these two scientists chemistry I believe they were they were, you know, Haber Bosch and they just created then currently Haber Bosch process and they created one drop of ammonia and they said yeah but we cannot do anything with one drop of ammonia and then they said okay chemical engineer will talk about, you know, they will think about how to scale up the process. So I believe that now the most important part is to find really a way to to find the right material and to find the right approach to get better and to achieve higher performance and then maybe we can think about process intensification and scaling up. And there are still a lot of basic research that we have to do and we have to dig in. Although I'm working on process intensification since a while combining catalyst and separation in the same unit. So complete in the same unit and we are going to decrease temperature, you're going to increase decrease temperature, pressure, increase the you know, increase efficiency. And yes for direct air capture, I don't think that the pressure is the main you know, or the concentration of CO2 because we are talking about 400 part per million and so if you would like to pump something and use the driving pressure, the driving force of CO2 through a membrane through a separation process I don't think it's going to work. Very well so we have to think maybe to something else and we have only 10 minutes so we can just wrap up and I'm going to shut up.",
