Uh and we've studied um I guess both uh when CO2 is bound to amine in the chemisorb state, we've looked both at processes um oxidatively to release the CO2 uh which is I think very well known to the community, but also to further reduce the CO2 and cycle it to either solid phases or um uh products like carbon monoxide for example. And so we uh we have done more work I would say uh looking in the non-aqueous space um flavors of those reactions and uh to try to understand some of the scientific underpinnings of those types of reactions. Uh and I will say they're very complicated um and we've spent a lot of time looking at the physical chemical properties of uh what happens when you take a capture solution and also uh kind of introduce functionalities to make it an electrolyte, um the electrochemistry becomes quite interesting and some of the uh let's say classical limiting behaviors that we take for granted in in very well defined electrochemical systems can sometimes go out the window and kind of necessitate um really looking at all aspects of the kinetics, mass transport and thermodynamics all over again. So it's been a really interesting scientific playground. Uh but then the question um that everybody always wants to know is, you know, is it practical and what is the cost and all of that and I would say it's very early days.",

So you could possibly use your own electricity in house to power a DAC system. Um so you're sending your electricity now to your own DAC system and you're also using compressed air off of the natural gas compressor possibly um to go to your DAC system, which is great because it's like 15 or 20 times the pressure of, you know, regular air, so you have higher partial pressures of CO2, so you can get much better performance from DAC. Um so that's the idea. There there's other concepts out there. They're proposing similarish things, but something like this where you can kind of oscillate between two modes and do some direct air capture.

Now we have great new vehicles that are now on the market and I can't say this anymore but I used to say, you know, look at look at what's really making a difference in your world. Look at the types of systems, you know, we need you cannot get away from basic mechanics and um sometimes uh one might even feel like incremental tweaks within an existing infrastructure will get us there faster and much more effectively. Um and so we shouldn't we shouldn't just be attracted to the kind of academically exciting concepts but also have deep reverence for the the real workhorse kind of stuff um and train our students that that's okay, right?

We talked about can we you know can we design sorbents that can switch between carbon capture and storage and DAC. Sorbent properties we discussed will we got on a tangent where we were talking about um that sorbents might can we just design a sorbent that works for both capture and storage but also um that that we one might one sorbent might not fit all the criteria because they're geographically specific or obviously the environment's going to play a role in what sorbent is a good sorbent. Um we said that sorbents operate we can we design sorbents that operate over a wide concentration, um so you can use them for DAC and natural gas. Then under again I I've just recently moved these all together trying to lump these together. Um DAC, are there DAC treatment trains that don't do not involve point of source? A lot of DAC you have a wet stream and potentially can be used directly with greenhouse and agriculture. Um but we were discussing basically like that there this is just opportunities of of different DAC systems. Okay, let's see. Um down here I've kind of put these as underneath DAC. Point of source versus direct air capture or combined. If you're building an infrastructure for point of source capture, um there's a a capital benefit for coupling. Um development and optimization of treatment trains may be a pathway to get to net negative over the life of the plant. Um and then there was a lot of discussion on soils which I some of that I did not I missed, but pre-concentrating CO2 in soils and buildings and leveraging HVAC systems. I think this is essentially having the discussion of um how we can combine existing infrastructure for DAC. Um and then the last kind of area was capture integrated with transportation. Okay, this is this is kind of goes along with this one. Um integrating capture with transportation. This is when people were talking about airplanes, submarines, spacecraft, um given the fuel consumption, especially in transportation, that's the motivation. Um combining capture with low carbon energy sources. Um we talked about the capital cost for right now direct air capture is around 300 to 500 dollars per ton, um where at point of source it's you know 100. Um and getting to 100 dollars per ton we discussed pragmatic engineering approaches um where repurposing infrastructure may get us there faster. Um we discussed briefly policy and its role and there was again an example of soil health where you can motivate farmers essentially um to use best practices because you know there might be a benefit to soil essentially a duality of benefits um beyond capture but also soil health. Um and yeah, the concrete if we can add some more this is when I was playing around with the organization if there's anything about the concrete that um you guys felt was salient that I missed, let me know.",

But it does have a very high ceiling for efficiency. And for conversion, Roger you probably know more about it than I do, but we also started getting into capture and conversion. Actually, I was on a lab piece proposal with Chris Hahn at Livermore on this topic and you know from I've always done CO2 conversion and we you know we feed it a 100% pure gas tank into our system. But if you when I started working on capture, I was like, you know, it's the release that's the energetically intensive part. So capture is really passive, relatively passive. So if we can just do direct conversion of that, then it would be much much more efficient. But then it's like a whole new substrate. You know, 30 years of chemists working on CO2 as a substrate, now we have to think about carbamates or alkoxides or sorry carbonates as substrates. It's a little bit of a different beast. I think there's a lot of fundamental science there. I think it's I mean, I love this meeting because there's tons of engineers, but I feel like I always think very differently where I'm like, what are the science questions? And they're like, it's a different, you know, I think there's a lot of fundamental science that needs to be done in terms of the chemistry of capture agents, activation, potentials, you know, stability under reductive conditions, things like that, that that need to be done, solubility, before we can really push forward on combined capture and conversion.",

Um based on our experience, it's not necessary like what I mentioned earlier, it's not necessary to get 100% pure of CO2 and and also it's not necessary to be the gas phase CO2. For example, if you have the sorbents in there, if we can directly electrochemically convert the CO2 sorbent you know complex directly to the fuels and chemicals, that that can eliminate away the desorption process which is the most energy consumption part that I mentioned. And also but that comes to another important point that I I noticed is depending on different type of point sources, depending on the compositions in these low CO2 streams, and also depending on the downstream CO2 conversion process, it might not be a universal rule, uh guideline to solve this problem. It's because for example, when you do the electrochemistry um to let's say reduce CO2 to to CO or formic acid, as long as there is oxygen in your stream, you will kill all the efficiency. So it really depends but for for different applications, oxygen won't make any impact. So it really depends on very specific downstream applications and your upstream compositions.

            "transcript": "Um, so you know, one of the brief themes that we had through our discussion was in terms of mechanisms of electrochemical CO2 reduction, do we even need to know the mechanism? And and this discussion was came out of um how the chemical process industry has developed prior to this with a lot of Esonian type experiments where they build things and maybe do a kind of um high throughput or some kind of screening at a relevant industrial scale to find operational conditions or not. And so it's an open question of do we first need to understand mechanisms at an atomic lab scale. Um, and then if those do translate, um, we need to make that translation clear because both computationally and experimentally, um looking at mechanisms are typically done on well defined surfaces or well defined systems with, you know, probably not a lot of flow or or um mass transport, but if we look at what this technology would potentially need to be at a high TRL, um probably the conditions would be very, very different and the mechanisms would probably change. And this has implications for both the materials, so materials durability, um and selectivity requirements changing as a function of operation conditions, um degradation modes will probably be different, you know, flooding happens at at larger scales and salt formations which may not need to be dealt with at the lab scale. So, um it's the kind of the two prong question of do we need to wait or even to say, do we even have the time to wait and look at this from the atomic scale up and take every step there or can we learn from some of the previous chemical process industry to see um we need kind of the large scale testing and assessment there to feed the relevant conditions into the the fundamental science. So we recognize the need for both the applied and fundamental work, but I think one of the key messages is that we need that feedback loop to be much quicker and more direct and lean on what's been done with with other even electrochemical technologies. Um, you know, part of that was, you know, defining a lot of our questions here aren't even specific to CO2, they're in general for electrochemical reactions and um, you know, then figuring out if we need to translate something, what we can probe and what we need to probe. So there's a lot of um spectroscopic and spectro electrochemical techniques that give kind of an averaging or an ensemble effect over a heterogeneous surface, um and that we lose information about single sites and single atoms and how they react. And I think both of those can be useful in in determining uh what how we need to develop a large scale um electrolyzer. Another point um that was brought up you know from the work that Charles did previously with with Jcap is uh the need for some kind of benchmarking in terms of materials but also reactor. Um and that has pros and cons from from how it was used from Jcap. It was brought up that, you know, yes we can look at um, you know, comparing materials in a very well defined system, but people may use these metrics to kind of gain the system and just focus on those metrics and ignoring others. So there's there's a um there's a dual side to having that kind of um, you know, benchmarking, but I think the CO2 reduction community is so broad and disparate right now, some formalization of that I think could be helpful for for a lot of teams. Um, you know, looking at what kind of characterization, I think we all agree and with the other group as well that operando and in situ characterization is absolutely necessary. Um, you know, doing ex situ work and looking at sites afterwards, there may be reconstruction um or or changes that are not due to the catalysis. So, um getting good time spatial and energetic resolution on various operando techniques is necessary.",

So as part of the first year of the silo, we have developed a gas tight rotating cylinder electrode cell where we put the model uh copper polycrystalline copper electrode and we rotate it at different uh rates. And as you rotate it, uh even though you have the same potential, you actually start to see dramatic changes in in selectivity. We already uh also we have the preprint in in our website. So what we see is that actually mass transport control selectivity and uh the the problem is a little bit more complex. So you actually have a lot of uh CO that is the main reaction intermediate that dissolves and hangs around near the surface of the electrode long enough so that the near the surface of the electrode actually behaves as a sort of CSTR, a continuous stirred tank reactor. And then uh what happens is that we get a lot of uh high conversion of CO. And uh theory is trying to do a lot of mechanistic understanding of of those systems actually on under high uh conversion of CO. And uh typically you don't study kinetics under under those conditions, right? Uh but now that I think we have a good uh system, right?

            "transcript": "Hi everyone. Um my name is Grishma Gadikota and I'm going to be uh reporting um for our team. I'm very grateful for David's support and for our facilitators Chris and Ellen as well as our excellent participants. So there were several aspects that came up uh over the course of our discussion uh particularly in the context of the need for DAC. Um so one of the nice things about direct air capture is that it can be deployed independently of point source emissions. And as we continue as we continue to use fossil fuels, there is going to be an increased need for DAC particularly from sectors that are challenging to decarbonize such as transportation. We're going to need DAC to clean up emissions from uh such sectors. Uh one of the interesting things that came up over the course of our discussion was the fact that there is considerable geographical variability in resources and how that might actually impact the deployment of CO2 capture and DAC technologies. So for example, if you're in regions of the world where uh moisture contents are different or in certain locations where the compositions of air are even different, separation technologies will need to be tailored for such regions. Uh this is a challenge but it's also an opportunity because it locks it it helps us unlock many fresh ideas and innovations in the context of DAC. Uh and perhaps you can take some of that understanding and translate that for CO2 capture as well from diverse set of um emissions. So with that said, our team uh sees the challenge of variability of compositions as something that can actually unlock more innovation. So we think it's actually a positive in the context of um innovating in this space. We also think that understanding durability, economic costs and incentive structures are crucial under real world operating conditions. And this actually goes back to the point that uh Carlos had made about uh the need for molecular scale science as well as the process scale engineering to come together to inform economic costs and incentive structure incentive structures. So the so really there is a need for cross scale thinking in this particular line of work. Uh this line this approach may be unconventional for some of the other research areas but in this area it is crucially needed. Uh another important consideration uh which is unique to DAC is that we need to consider the end fate of CO2 and that would really dictate where we would actually put or implement DAC is that CO2 going to be stored underground? Is it going to be coupled to utilization? Is it going to be coupled to mineralization? In which case the kind of DAC technology that would get deployed might need to get customized. And also this brought up the question of uh CO2 conversion to products and our team took the view that CO2 conversion to products is insufficient from the perspective of climate. We wrapped up our discussion from a rather big picture perspective of where DAC and CO2 capture are headed. And so when we look at industrial decarbonization, we're starting to see that there is defossilization of crucial commodities like ammonia, even cement and construction materials. This is something that's going to get realized over the course of the next 10 to 20 years or so. So in this context of defossilization, what is going to be the emerging role of DAC and CO2 capture? It's an open ended question but that is where we choose to wrap up our discussion. So thank you for the opportunity to present.",

            "transcript": "Yes, so I'm Katie Knowles, I'll be sort of reporting out what we did based on the sort of detailed notes that Ellen took uh during our discussion. And so um so we're talking about uh materials for separation and storage and uh we talked a lot about the challenges for materials discovery and development. And I think some of these um are continuing on some themes that were discussed in other groups. So gaps between computational predictions and experiments, the fact that like if um if a computational study identifies a new material that might be um advantageous for uh separation or storage application, it takes time to actually synthesize that material or it might not be possible to synthesize that material. So um taking uh feasibility into account when doing these um these uh sort of computational uh predictions. Um we also I uh identified the the need for training sets for machine learning approaches. So um uh sufficient characterization data under the dynamic operating conditions that a lot of these um sorbents uh work under um is needed uh for for this. Um we also talked about some of the challenges with scale up. So so lab scale experiments synthesis versus application scale. Um so things that you consider to be in operando on the lab scale might not truly represent your application scale um conditions. I think this was touched on in some other groups. Um so degradation processes and reversibility or cyclability issues for the um the sorbents that you know, absorb and then we want to release the CO2 at like the storage or conversion um area. A lot of these sorbents function at non-equilibrium conditions, so might eventually break down. Um some of these degradation products might be sort of the active materials in the storage or catalysis that you're doing. Um and then I think this point kind of goes back into the modeling where we need to understand what the uncertainties are in the model uh uh predictions in order to um you know, apply them in a useful way. Also interfaces are key in these uh sort of material applications but hard to understand. So interfaces is where most of the action happens but it's all these complex processes occur. The interfacial structure is dynamic and different than bulk structure and therefore hard to characterize. Um we also talked about some underexplored sort of physical phenomena related to um CO2 separation and storage. Um in this uh sort of the area of sorbents, we talked about light or using light or electrochemistry or humidity swings to trigger desorption might be sort of new um axes to think about um in this context. Um for storage, we talked about CO2 mineralization and some physical phenomena that needed to kind of understand or accelerate that process um or better understandings of precipitation and dissolution phenomena both sort of solid liquid. So at the solid liquid um interface when you're um sort of forming these sort of solid minerals and at the liquid gas interface when you're actually dissolving CO2 into your liquid um sorbent. We also talked about um some interesting ideas about mining, coupling mineralization with mining of valuable elements. And then finally we talked about some design criteria to keep in mind when when thinking about these things. So thermal conductivity especially if um you know, the heats of adsorption and desorption are playing a role in the sorbents, electrical conductivity for the electrochemical materials, transparency if we're talking about using uh light as a trigger. Um materials that can accommodate self-healing or assisted healing processes. Um and then just taking a lot of knowledge from the catalysis community um that they've developed about um adsorption and desorption and sort of balancing the energetics of those two processes and to inform the design of materials for um I think thinking about sorbents again in this case. So I think that sums up a lot of what we talked about.",

            "timestamp": "05:04-09:58",
            "transcript": "Um so we talked about methane capture and valorization and one of the initial um starts of the conversation was what are the potential emitters or emissions. Um and so we're thinking agricultural sites, um fossil fuels of course is a major emitter. Um but then also we have methane in the atmosphere. And so is it really conducive to uh try to capture um if we're going for negative emissions, methane out of the atmosphere and you know, how would that work? Will we work from point sources or do we work from dilute sources? And um it seems like we had agreement that maybe point sources would be the best option. However, um even if we try to um develop some sort of technology that can take methane from these point sources, they're actually pretty dilute in terms of they have a lot of variability. Um where you can have a few PPMs of methane to hundreds of PPM. Um for example at agricultural sources. And then there's other mediations um for removing methane. Um uh for example from cows and that's changing their diets and and um other technological innovations like having the mask or something. Um but if we talk about uh developing technological solutions that we can eventually implement here with the um people there within this group, um we talked about a lot of different things. And I'd say that you can probably divide it into three. So it's leaving the chemistry of methane alone, the molecule, which is naturally nonpolar and then doing something with that, maybe changing the pressure or temperature to try to store it. Um the second is trying to make it more reactive. And so we talked about the idea of reactive absorption. And then the last thing um is actually taking inspiration from nature. So using microbes. And so um the I'll go along this list of possible solutions. One of the first ones was why don't we just oxidize methane all the way to CO2? Um and even though it sounds like it might be counterintuitive, we could potentially possibly integrate this in direct air capture um technology. And so um even though it is um something that might sound controversial, it still will get the ball rolling because we have existing technology for um direct air capture that we can possibly utilize in combination with some sort of oxidation of methane steam. Another um possible solution is actually um forming methane clathrates. And so if this solution if we was to um approach it is to add water, have high pressures, but the downside is that you have very low temperatures about -20 degrees Celsius to form these methane clathrates. And actually this is a solution that has been um starting to develop in Japan and they actually have some technology to do this. Um another um idea that was really exciting um in terms of of the way that we would add some sort of functionality or activity to methane is what we uh deem as reactive absorption. Um which is also something that's explored with CO2 as well. Um so the ideas explored here was the use of electric fields to some somehow mediate methane absorption or we can use light to activate the carbon hydrogen bonds. Um so that it's more reactive to absorption of a sorbate uh sorbent species. Um there's also when um some interest perhaps in the development of electro photocatalyst systems in which we can activate the methane um and then um sort of uh convert it into something that's more reactive and then um uh in a for in effect have a negative emission technology here or um do some sort of radical chemistry that can um pull these bonds away and they get more reactive. Um and as far as inspiration from nature, um we can also have methane capture by enzymes. There is this enzymes that can absorb methane um at relatively low concentrations and at um ambient pressures. Um and then there's also microbes that can capture methane um from relatively low concentrations as well. Um that's everything that we discussed for the methane capture valorization uh conversation and adjust.",
