In different contexts. But I'm just wondering like as these things get scaled up, how is this going to look like and are we going to hit the bottleneck and where are these bottlenecks, right? For example, some people say we need iridium oxide um for an oxygen evolution reaction, but we have absolutely nearly not enough iridium on planet Earth um to to implement.

For example, what is the activation energy for like platinum 111 surface for hydrogen evolution reaction? I couldn't even find such uh data which I thought there should be a lot.

Um, and, you know, obviously the question is, you know, how how fast we can achieve the CO2 uh conversion in, you know, in relation to how much, how fast we can capture. So those are the uh things I'm interested in and since my background is on mostly um non-aqueous electrolytes, um, you know, when you when you go through non-aqueous electrolytes, things can get messy. So one of the challenges in my research is, you know, what are the tools we can have in order to, you know, study these interfaces which are kind of buried interfaces. So what what tools do we need really need in order to understand the correct mechanism, you know, uh apart from, you know, what the what's happening on the electrode surface in terms of, you know, whether if it's a copper surface, you're characterizing copper, but what could what can we think about in terms of the methods that can probe the liquid, right?

They make persulfates um, that uh, go into fertilizer for the most part. Um, and and and many other chemicals and the entire reason for them being situated near Niagara Falls was cheap hydropower, right? Because it's an electrochemical process and the way they've scaled it uh, for again also 100 years, they use lead electrodes for everything. Massive huge lead electrodes incredibly environmentally bad, but it works works great for them. And so the uh, environmental agency in New York called us and said, you know, see if you can replace them with something better. Uh, but uh, but yeah, it it it's it's chemistry that works at huge scales. They have like, you know, tons of uh, persulfates that are that are kind of getting out there. It's you can so if you can find something like that that you can make that goes into other industries, I think Jenny's point is is excellent.",

I think that goes back to Burge's question like, you know, which one is the most accessible. And then somebody was arguing for methanol. They said that over a technoeconomic analysis on how much CO2 there is out there, methanol is the largest value product or the most uh the most accessible and everything else is the need of the market is too small. I'm not sure if that's correct or is that was that is that grounded or any facts.",

So so maybe electrochemistry is at the heart of all the negative emissions technologies that that is a possibility but it would really help me to know like kind of where what what is the consensus like where where will electrochemistry come in and play like the dominant role. Maybe at this stage this is too early to say that and we are in a phase where we're kind of like scouting around and trying to figure out like how how we're solving this problem in the first place, right? But I I generally think um yeah, I I really would like to figure out um like where uh where we are where where electrochemistry is is is making an impact and whether there are like a certain set of categories maybe electro catalysis, electrochemical capture. Um I don't know, we don't have much time left but if if anyone uh wants to chime in, I would be interested.",
