For example, certain absorption of gases leads to some of these materials becoming brittle. Some of the absorption can result in volume changes and all of this affects material reversibility and fatigue. Um so that's one thing that I could see as a limitation of current materials, but of course there are challenges on the thermodynamic and kinetic aspects as well, but um that's how I'm looking at this problem.",

A lot of these materials are very, very heterogeneous materials and you know, if you look at the materials at a very small length scale, they're all different in the you know, between the neighboring domains and they have different uh phase distribution and mechanical mechanical effect coming out of that as well. And that really brings up the the challenges for how do we properly categorize this kind of materials. Uh categorizing materials in a very heterogeneous system without knowing how to characterize the material, we might not be able to establish the the true relationship between the properties and and the synthesis. And the other thing is that the the the computational efforts, right? We now at the point that we can predict so many things and there was a very interesting article on chemistry of materials a few uh a few weeks ago about predictive synthesis. So we can predict synthesis using computer, but if you look into those kind of predictions very, very closely, sometimes they even violate the very basic kinetic or even thermodynamic laws. Um and we need to have experimental verification of the theoretical studies. But at this point, either the performance testing or the materials characterization are much slower than the rate of computation. So we need to have um advanced tools that can categorize materials that can measure performance at a much faster rate. Meanwhile, we need to use more advanced data analytic analytical methods, uh not just conventional data analysis, you need to have, you know, machine learning or that kind of capability to to do large scale data analysis for experimental results and then they can couple with high throughput theoretical prediction. I think that's a lot of gap right now between what can be synthesized and what is predicted.",

Uh for some of the polymer absorbents is even harder. I think the synthesis takes much longer. So uh I was approached about doing some high throughput on some of the types of polymer materials that we have and one of the limitations is actually doing the absorption tests. If you're doing it like a like a well-defined thermal absorption it's maybe easier than doing an electrochemical absorption. So I think uh one of the main uh challenges for some of these types of materials is finding some sort of test that can infer the final absorption without actually going and doing it. So if there's some sort of midway interaction that we can collect a lot of data uh because they said we need this amount of data and we are two orders of magnitude less in terms of the materials that we can actually be useful for their training set. So I thought that was one of the challenges. Um and then one of the other challenges I thought that a lot of the computational screening is being used for affinity of the CO2 um and the selectivity, but I think it'd be nice if the computational chemistry folks could develop also stability tests uh instead of just equilibrium equilibrium binding, they could also develop high throughput kinetic um tests somehow that they can say uh screen out things that won't be stable because if we do that experimentally it's going to be so much work.",

And uh I would say that uh there's very few design principles because uh the way that people have taken them, they've taken them for energy storage materials. So the these are materials that weren't originally designed to be separation materials and there's a very limited amount of materials. So like let's say uh for some other things you can like uh amino resins you can have maybe hundreds of them. for redox groups you perhaps at most would have five that are stable. it's very limited.

This is to study for example the evolution of the mineral interfaces to identify for example molecules that could enhance the dissolution and therefore make all these processes faster and more feasible also. Then also studies at the interfaces could be related to the precipitation because generally mineral carbonation is performed that there is a silicate minerals that is dissolved produces calcium and magnesium ions that then react with CO2 and they produce carbonates. So there are two surface control processes where would be interesting to essentially combine experiments and and modeling. Regarding also if one would like to see other aspects of CO2 mineralization and see the potential of this process also to recover or to have some benefits that go beyond CO2 storage for CO2 mineralization more recently people are thinking using brines. Brines produce water, geothermal brines, salt lake brines. And so these are very complex water with high salinity. And so we don't only want to take calcium and magnesium to precipitate carbonates but we could and then essentially dispose of all the rest but in this rest there are valuable elements. And so we could membranes for example that could allow to have an effective separation of low concentration elements like lithium, manganese, copper, cobalt and there are so would be very they would would be very interesting to do research in this field. The challenges are the low concentration, the complexity of the brine and the salinity. But the concentration are such that could be an interesting let's say coupling CO2 mineralization and mining of valuable elements.

Particularly for solid adsorbents but I assume for liquid sorbents as well. And I think particularly when you're thinking about thermal swing type processes for absorbing and desorbing CO2 you're kind of there's intrinsic kind of thermodynamic inefficiencies that are kind of built into what you're doing. So like absorbing CO2 is always going to be exothermic and that's going to heat up your material and when your material gets hot it's going to absorb less CO2 in almost every case. And so you need to have systems in place to manage those temperature increases during absorption processes. But then you want to put heat into your material to desorb the CO2 so there's kind of an inefficiency there because you're trying to dissipate a bunch of heat just to put a bunch of heat back in. And so there's opportunities to think about how to to deal with that. And the same is true during desorption. Desorption is endothermic so your material gets colder and holds on to CO2 if you're doing a pure thermal swing. And so I think thinking about that is important and then also just there's usually not very much that's understood about thermal conductivity of different types of sorbents and that's a property that's not often measured but is really important in terms of being able to have easier an easier ability to control heat transport and manage temperature fluctuations in any kind of CO2 capture system.",

I think two of the big systems level problems that we have or at least maybe device first on the device level is you usually need an electrolyte and a liquid and that if you're bubbling something through you have a lot of mass transfer challenges so I think one of the big challenges of actually implementing is figuring out ways to do it with a direct gas phase sorbent that has electronic conductivity without the need for a liquid electrolyte. The other big problem is the counter electrode. You often have the one electrode being used for CO2 capture and then the counter electrode usually is very inefficient and it's often getting destroying something so optimizing the counter electrode is also one of the problems. So one way that folks have come up with systems is one electrode is absorbing and the other one is releasing in some sort of swing system that's symmetric so that was perhaps one of some of the challenges there.",

So there are different phase that you can go through and I mean I'm a process engineer as a background. You will find out the way in order to put your best material because I'm not a material science so I'm always relying on material on people that works on the material and say hey is it going to work okay I will figure out how to do how to put this material in our system absorption desorption temperature swing pressure swing. I also heard humidity swing if I well understood. So there will be way to brainstorm how to how to put this material in order that is going to work and in order that is not going to lose efficiency.

So basically like you know so we have all these machine learning things are great but like actually keeping it connected to what experimentalists are actually can do on a reasonable time scale. We also talked about the gap between lab scale and application scale um and then these degradation processes I think we were talking about towards the end. So these reversibility cyclability issues the fact that many of these I think particularly in the the sorbents function as sort of these non-equilibrium conditions like this part of how they work is that you know you're you're you're you're changing um their operating conditions and then does that contribute to these degradation processes.

So once you have a system that has very long residence time for carbon monoxide, then you start to look at it more sort of as a flat flow reactor. So long story short, I think the challenge was to get an electrochemical cell that allows you to control mass transport and at the same time allows you to do product quantification and detection. Um so I think we have accomplished that through and I think that that should open the the door to scale up these systems.",

I'd like I'm very grateful for David's support and for our facilitators Chris and Ellen as well as our excellent participants. So there were several aspects that came up uh over the course of our discussion uh particularly in the context of the need for DAC. Um so one of the nice things about direct air capture is that it can be deployed independently of point source emissions. And as we continue as we continue to use fossil fuels, there is going to be an increased need for DAC, particularly from sectors that are challenging to decarbonize such as transportation. We're going to need DAC to clean up emissions from uh such sectors. Uh one of the interesting things that came up over the course of our discussion was the fact that there is considerable geographical variability in resources and how that might actually impact the deployment of CO2 capture and DAC technologies. So for example, if you're in regions of the world where uh moisture contents are different or in certain locations where the compositions of air are even different, separation technologies will need to be tailored for such regions. Uh this is a challenge but it's also an opportunity because it locks it it helps us unlock many fresh ideas and innovations in the context of DAC. Uh and perhaps we can take some of that understanding and translate that for CO2 capture as well from diverse set of um emissions. So with that said, our team uh sees the challenge of variability of compositions as something that can actually unlock more innovation. So we think it's actually a positive in the context of um innovating in this space. We also think that understanding durability, economic costs and incentive structures are crucial under real world operating conditions. And this actually goes back to the point that uh Carlos had made about uh the need for molecular scale science as well as the process scale engineering to come together to inform economic costs and incentive structure incentive structures. So so really there is a need for cross scale thinking in this particular line of work. Uh this line this approach may be unconventional for some of the other research areas but in this area it is crucially needed. Uh another important consideration uh which is unique to DAC is that we need to consider the end fate of CO2 and that would really dictate where we would actually put or implement DACs. Is the CO2 going to be stored underground? Is it going to be coupled to utilization? Is it going to be coupled to mineralization? In which case the kind of DAC technology that would get deployed might need to get customized. And also this brought up the question of uh CO2 conversion to products and our team took the view that CO2 conversion to products is insufficient from the perspective of climate. We wrapped up our discussion from a rather big picture perspective of where DAC and CO2 capture are headed. And so when we look at industrial decarbonization, we're starting to see that there is defossilization of crucial commodities like ammonia, even cement and construction materials.",

Um given the fact that a lot of the infrastructure can be repurposed um and having that onsite is going to be potentially an economic advantage for that approach. Um we talked a lot about Zorbins. Um uh just we talked about Ecam, electrochemistry and Zorbins. Um most of our discussion was on Zorbins, a little bit of Ecam at the end, but from the Zorbins we talked about it'd be nice to have a singular Zorbent that operated um across various concentrations so you could um have it um very versatile in terms of operating with point of source as well as direct air capture and both of those applications where you have concentrations. We talked about the challenges again with different properties based off your geographic locations and why that might be a more of a challenge to have a singular um Zorbent. Um we talked about uh again larger scale issues um in terms of treatment trains, um whether we want to integrate um direct air capture with point of source or we want to combine those um to produce um uh you know fuels or integrated with conversion applications. Um how we integrate multiple technologies is going to be a um energy systems level challenge. Um we also talked a little bit about uh kind of how we can innovative ways for um integrating direct air capture. There was a lot of discussion on um transportation um areas like planes, submarines, spacecraft, things where we have a lot of moving parts already and how can we potentially utilize these systems that have existing infrastructure that would be valuable for DAC um as a way to um accentuate DAC as it exists. Um given that the fossil fuel and DOE announced today the Earth shot for $100 um per ton for DAC. Um we talked about what are pathways toward that goal. Um whether the innovation um and advancement in science and new technology will get us there. Um some of the thoughts were really about how we can just use repurposing um and potentially the less glamorous um approach of like how can we take um abandoned coal mines or abandoned infrastructure and repurpose that for DAC systems may be the fastest way to getting to that goal. Um however ambitious that is because most um DAC is around $300 to $500 currently. Um we briefly talked about policy um and uh the different opportunities and there was a one cited evidence of of a uh positive policy um or a mutualistically positive policy um where farmers if we're thinking about um carbon um capture in soils, um there's mutualistic benefit to the farmer for soil health and different ways that we can inter um interject policy to um accelerate the adoption of DAC. Um and lastly we ended our conversation not to um let electrochemistry um not hit the stage a little bit about really um the versatility of electrochemical systems for carbon capture and carbon conversion. Um right now um in terms of electrochemical Zorbent, we might not have the right Zorbent but there's a lot of basic science in terms of engineering um molecules and understanding um fundamental science related to solubility and um mixed gases and how they're going to react in these um electrochemical systems. Um as well as fundamental interfaces and surface science um that needs to be understood.",

We also talked about, um, some interesting ideas about mining, coupling mineralization with mining of valuable elements. And then finally we talked about some design criteria to keep in mind when, when thinking about these things. So thermal conductivity, especially if, um, you know, the heats of adsorption and desorption are playing a role in the sorbents, electrical conductivity for the electrochemical materials, transparency, if we're talking about using, uh, light as a trigger, uh, materials that can accommodate self-healing or assisted healing processes, um, and then just taking a lot of knowledge from the catalysis community, um, that they've developed about, um, adsorption and desorption and sort of balancing the energetics of those two processes and to inform the design of materials for, um, I think thinking about sorbents again in this case.
