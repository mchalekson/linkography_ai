In their paper, they actually um predict that even the biomass is lower than that from the Earth ocean, uh ammonia, even the trace amount of ammonia, we're talking about sub PPM level can be detected by JWC. So this is just one example. So I think my point is that people have studied that. Um, of course, there are a lot of assumptions going into the calculation, but I think from the ballpark it's doable even with the, you know, slightly the, you know, next generation or even the current generation telescope, which is JWC.

Um, but I was kind of had been thinking along the lines of um, yeah, that how the volatile reservoirs evolve and how the ratios of volatiles that are in the total inventory of the planet evolve over time due to outgassing, loss due to the stellar magnetic field in the case of an exoplanet, um, and then recycling back into the interior.

But in the deposits you have other information about what the flow conditions were uh which would be less sensitive to the presence of life. Um like the presence of bars or grain size that that kind of stuff. And so you have a bunch of of pieces that you can put together to constrain the other parameters that could affect bed forms, you can make predictions of what they should look like if there was no life and then compare, you know, what they should look like with what they actually look like and potentially say something about whether um, you know, there was there was life.",

There are both biotic and abiotic ways to produce gases that have redox couples. But the only way that you cycle things down from sedimentary rock back into the planet is purely abiotic and that's just subduction or tectonics or something physical and there's no biological way to do that. It's utterly dependent on having those big geological processes in motion. Now is that necessary for life? I have no idea. Um or is it necessary for a biosphere? Uh but I think maybe it's important to make a distinction between processes that are um perhaps only accelerated by biology or facilitated by biology versus processes that are dependent upon um large scale abiotic systems being in place.

It does warm over time because the sun is brightening and you get ex solution of carbon uh which is a positive feedback uh you get ex uh the warmer ocean can store less carbon.

So um so so the simp the the the the answer to your question, I think is is no in the sense that, you know, you could imagine other buffering chemistries. But um to the extent that something in the realm of circumneutral, you know, like seven, I don't know, let's say eight plus or minus 1.5 pH units, um to the extent that that's important, then um that actually cuts down on the number of buffering systems that you can uh uh you know, plausibly invoke um just because of the PKs of of uh of the systems. And of course that'll change if if you if you fiddle around with pressure and temperature to some extent, but um so so the carbonic acid system is a um is a is a good one. And and also gives you a ready tie to uh regulation of of CO2 and climate over time in in ways that um uh I mean you you can conceivably do something similar with the sulfuric acid system and SO2. I I think you could probably imagine that, but the pH is in the in the fluids start to become uh uh pretty pretty low.

Like life arises, it uses some available substrate and it runs out of it and then that's the end. Um and that there's no way for a cycling to continue to replenish what it needs because there's no nothing a priori says that the organic molecules or the uh molecules dependent on the origin of life are going to be linked to biogeo geochemical cycles in such a way that they will be available in the future. That seems to be contingent at least, I would think so. So like can we think of situations where it would be obvious that this would be a dead end situation and it's only fortuitous that you happen to be get get connected to cycling of things that are needed for life's persistence or alternatively, you know, imagine that you produce life at some point produces um materials or compounds that are inimical to its continued existence.",
