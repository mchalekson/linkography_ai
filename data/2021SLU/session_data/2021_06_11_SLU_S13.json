That you you often hear the retort that well extreme to us is is not extreme to others, right? Our conditions are extreme to some organisms and it it suggests that across the board the notion of extreme is entirely relative. And I wonder if we can poke at that assumption a little bit because you know, I I of course it matters if if the conditions that that allow the origin of life are more restrictive, right? Then there is a center point and and life can radiate out from that. So maybe it's worth asking um are all conditions equivalently permissive to that origin so that the center point can move equivalently anywhere in in parameter space. Um and is there such a thing as as an absolute extreme instead of a relative extreme as as Solange just described, you know, one person's great is another person's terrible. Is there something that's terrible for everyone?",

I think that we would all agree, but we might give different answers as to why we think that's true.

He had a paper last year. I just pasted in the chat. I'll put it on the slack so we have it for later where um he found a fungus that would grow in just ridiculously high perchlorate. It was like two and a half molar, which, you know, is is not quite one of these, you know, transient brines or things like that. But I think that just shows that at uh some of this stuff we can push it further than we think and we're kind of talking about two different ideas here whether it's you know, the the surface of IO sure maybe not, but at um yeah the, you know, these hypersaline environments. Um, you know, I I I think that um the sort of to the question of um, you know, the the sort of dark matter of these experiments where we're looking at hypersaline environments and the ones that look like they didn't work.

And that will happen at different levels for different kinds of bonds representing different functionality. So things would sort of sequentially fall off the table as possibilities that are open to life as you move along a temperature scale and and maybe more subtly things that we think you need for life like really high fidelity molecular recognition, you know, so not covalent bonds but non covalent chemistry, things like that. Um, can you imagine putting yourself anywhere on the temperature scale and still getting that that kind of possibility represented.

This is something we've thought a lot about with um the work with perchlorate and Mars because one thing that um, you know, the the reason perchlorate is so interesting to me not just because of Mars is because it's on the far end of this ranking of ions called the Hofmeister series where it's on this end of what are called catropes. Um, and what catropes tend to do is, you know, they unfold biopolymers and part of that is bringing organics into solution and and you know, thinking about organics, you know, it's usually like a hydrophobic core of a protein. Um, so that can have pretty profound effects on, you know, solubility of organics and things like that as well as, you know, obviously that's going to influence folding behavior of biopolymers. So it's not quite speaking to the same thing that Amanda and I have been talking about in terms of like bond energies and things like that, but I think that also ties into, you know, really important things about life and biochemical systems or even alternative biochemical systems because um, you know, folding in water is so driven by the fact that water wants to interact with water and that's kind of the origin of the hydrophobic effect that uh, you know, the both salt and being sub or supercritical water can change these in pretty profound ways. So I I completely agree that I think uh salinity could also have profound impacts and that's also going to depend strongly on the identity of the ion because sulfate is going to behave very differently than something like perchlorate.",

So so far we've talked a lot about the the spectrum of possibility from a biological perspective, but part of our problem was was relating to very specifically eroded Neptune cores, um, which I know that one of you knows a lot about and and I personally know very little about. Um, and and you know, what I hear from the exoplanet community is very often like if you can imagine it, we can find it out there somewhere in a in a population of planets. So I'm curious for this specific population that's represented in our prompt, is that really true or is there a specific range of things that you perceive to be possible so that we can think from both directions, right? Here here's what's permissible from the planet formation end, here's what's permissible from the biological end.",

So uh we've had some discussion about late heavy bombardment and these other sort of catastrophic uh events and and one of the suggestions was if life got a foothold, maybe even the late heavy bombardment isn't enough. if something developed on an early uh sub Neptune or Neptune object, can can it survive a an event of that magnitude or or is that just game game over for everything that's there?",

You could still Edwin Kite and Laura Shafer have an interesting paper where they say you could still produce water as the from the reactions of the hydrogen with the magma. Um, but then other groups say, oh, you we'd probably form a bunch of have a bunch of material migrating from beyond the snow line in which case these would have a lot of water in their interiors. And yeah, there's some like one example is K218B is a planet where it has an appropriate kind of distance from its star and and radius and mass such that it depending there's a range of uncertainties, but it could potentially go through um pressure temperature space where you could have kind of liquid water um on its surface before you get to a rocky core.",
