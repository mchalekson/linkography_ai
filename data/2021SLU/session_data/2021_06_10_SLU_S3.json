They're going to have 12 different properties each, their stars are going to have different properties.

And it's probably not going to be the case, at least it wasn't in galactic science where you go from a sample of five to suddenly you have a sample of a billion. The closest we've got is Gaia where we went from a sample of 100,000 to a billion. So I don't see, you know, I I think that there's even in the next phase beyond what's what's coming up now, uh samples are going to have to be chosen very carefully. And so it's going to be very important I think to um think about the correlations uh between the the you know, the planet properties that we do get for those for those, you know, nearest by systems and um other other properties of the system.",

And currently the running rate is about $300 million per planet if you can't uh both ground based and space based, that's roughly the within a factor of two. So that's a key science parameter that determines the architecture, it determines what size of pet you want to build, but we are building both an exploration mission and also a hypothesis testing science mission at the same time. And so I think that uh I I think this is a really interesting discussion to see what what is the complexity that we expect and what is the right strategy and what kind of complexity can we test in a population that we haven't explored yet.",

And that included both trying to figure out the frequency of Earth like planets and building a statistical sample that would give us enough to be able to say something about if we didn't find any life, what does that actually mean and have a useful number. Um but also looking at larger planets and trying to look at planetary systems as a whole. Um and I think that was really fruitful because it wasn't just one question. It wasn't just is there oxygen on this particular planet or on these 10 planets. It was actually allowing us to do more than just search for life. Um and Havoc has a different design and had to make different choices about the number of planets, but they also I think did that really creatively.

So I think there are there are perhaps some questions that are completely inaccessible to the smaller Havoc scale meeting like mission, like um time variability on a given planet perhaps. But the other questions that you could address with either, it would be kind of the level of scope. Like and and it would be somewhat what you would like if 50 if 50% of planets in the habitable zone have a detectable bio signature, then Havoc would detect one, but if that's optimistically not the case, then um you'd have a null result and just set some kind of upper limit. And and the upper limit that you'd get from a null result with Havoc is just a lot less informative than with Luvoir. It's still informative given our current prior state of knowledge, but um yeah, I I would kind of divide the questions into two different categories. There's some that you could just still do with Havoc, but definitely do way better with Luvoir and then there are others that like just are inaccessible.",

Because we've worked on this on different instruments and so on and so forth. So if we just erase that slate, right? If we erase Havoc, if we erase Luvoir, um I don't know, is there something that we can do theoretically uh or or practically, you know, which is like some you know, the idea is this allows us to mix and even if the ideas are crazy and if we don't come up with something that's fine, but I'm just thinking this this is kind of a unique opportunity to think about what we could be doing because this is I'm throwing something out that I don't think you should be doing.

I've seen a lot of these flow down charts for bio signature studies in the system science context where you're talking about one planet and first you observe it at low resolution and then if you see, you know, water vapor, maybe you observe it at higher resolution or you look for oxygen and then you know you do this sequence of of observations, but I haven't seen and I mean maybe it exists, but I I I haven't seen uh anyone look at how you do this with large numbers of planets, right? You what what happens if you what what's the observation that you make that you start with five and then if you see something with those five, then you double the sample, but maybe now include stellar age or stellar type as another access over which you're investigating. basically how you how you might build out the statistical sample um in a in a systematic way based on on on some guiding question.",

Um and so and and sometimes we'll only get the dominant background gas and we won't even kind of have an understanding of what trace species are doing. Uh and so if you can if if if all you've got is kind of a background gas and maybe um all right I shouldn't say background gas I should say like dominant molecular, you know, absorber, it's kind of like the only thing that you get.

So so it's not I I completely had the same idea that you had before that uh that a moon was essential, but every biologist I've spoken so far actually uh does not agree with that notion. So I think it's something that um is very interesting to see, you know, how often do these crashes happen and I think uh an even more interesting thing is like are these crashes a requirement or very useful for plate tectonics? I think this is where it becomes actually very interesting because that is different, right? So the moon is now stabilizing or doing the rotation thing or stabilizing the seasons, but maybe it's helping get plate tectonics started. That's uh kind of line of thought that a couple of people were thinking about making a moon potentially important. Sorry, but um is there anything that that you guys want to want to discuss of those ideas or do we just have a potpourri of ideas and then whenever you have like the the get together with all the the fellows only, uh you're going to flesh out something more?

Is that the fraction that have liquid water at that given instant or is that the fraction that ever had liquid water? Um but we've done theoretical studies of having planets freeze over and then melt again or have cycles in their evolution. So I think if you couple this with a bunch of models of planets then maybe you could eventually get at that and then maybe you would have signs like if you were somehow able to measure the D to H ratio perhaps you could see signs of water loss over longer time scales in these systems. But then you wouldn't know what the original ratio was unless you had other planets in the system and it like it gets much more complicated as you ask these questions and I think it it all points back to wanting a really big sample which is hard.",

Um and so you can push to lower signal noise and lower resolutions than using traditional methods. Um and so methodology you know, having hybrid approaches to methodologies, not just traditional approaches for measuring you know, atmospheric parameters, actually building in machine learning tools is going to be an important part of of how you go from um dealing with small sample sizes when you to going to dealing with large sample sizes or large volumes of data. Um that's maybe the main lesson learned but that probably is not going to be so much of an issue here because everything can probably run by PT analysis given that it's, you know, five to 500 systems. Um, but it might be the case that some of the molecular stuff especially on the M dwarf side really needs um, you know, very difficult line lists and molecular features that are very poorly understood.

They'll have a different evolution, they have a different maybe metallicity, they have a different age. How you'd actually put that into context? Because, you know, you pick five but they're still going to have gone through a completely different or trying to find five completely similar star systems that you can observe at similar distances will not be very possible. So I'm kind of asking the question in a way it's like how would you be able to put evolution in or would you not, right? And it comes a little bit of what, you know, Leslie was was asking is like would you know that this water is temporary or not? You you would not, right? And you would not know if this system has actually maintained the water through the last four billion years. Like we have there was no way of getting to that. But so how to um how to interpret whatever you find. You know, even if you have five, if you have 100, if you have 500 uh how that changes your interpretation.",
