It seems that there's a strong focus on on very basic life forms if you want primitive kind of similar to the unicellular life we we have on earth, uh microbial life. Uh but do we actually have a good understanding of what the probability would be for life on a planet on which life has evolved? What's the probability for that life to have reached levels of complexity that would generate macro structures that we can look for like like forests for example or or colonies or biofilms and so on. So I mean we know how long it took for life on earth to reach that transition to that upper level of complexity, but do we have reasons to believe that perhaps it could take less time or or more time on other planets um and and how hopeful can we be to to encounter such macro structures.",

Um, and how would that have affected the amount of primary productivity going on in early Earth as a bioinformatician, I'm thinking of course, how can I look at the data that we have now to try to recreate what were the limiting nutrients um at different periods in Earth history. We can look at modern microbial um communities and get a sense of what limiting nutrients are based on pan genomes um and looking at what the gene content looks like. And so I've been thinking about can we apply that to the deep past to try to get a sense of what the limiting nutrients might have been because when we're thinking about biosignatures, it all comes down to fluxes, you know, of these gases that are emerging. And if we don't know how much life there was and like how limiting nutrients affected primary productivity, we're not going to get at that flux problem. So that's what I've been thinking about.",

So I wonder along whether or not it's universal, um, do we can we connect this to the type of star that the planet will host or that will host a planet and where it is, how big it is, is it a moon? Um, I mean, I think that there are lots and does it move, right? Because I think that we we now understand that planets don't stay where they were born, they move around. So there is a lot of um, there's a lot of changes that are imposed from the outside that I wonder how they um, how they translate into processes within the planet.",

So we need to also think about environments that will be similar to early earth to go pick up those redfield ratios to make prediction and not necessarily in the open ocean today for example or uh other type of uh environment that are not representative of this early earth.

            "transcript": "Yeah, um, I mean I I can't really speak too much about like like outside of our solar system. I'm I'm not as familiar with a lot of that a lot of those kind of studies. Um, in terms of the meteorite composition that we've measured just from falls on earth and then, you know, for example, like some of the ongoing work that they're doing like with the sample recovery at Benu and things like that. Like I I would expect well, um, I mean the the the and just going back to amino acids just because it's a it's a good example. Um, but this could I'm sure this applies to a lot of other organic building blocks. Um, you know, the the the the history of like a meteorite in terms of, you know, like heating and um, like melting of ice and like those those those processing cycles really can play a big role in terms of the organics that we detect, right? And so, you know, like for example, um, like all the the amino acids in our proteins are um have like an alpha carbon, right? But there are different structural isomers of amino acids and in some amino acids, you know, like like ones that have longer carbon chains are like much way more upregulated than others, right? Um, the for example like Murchison one of the reasons why that caught so much attention one one it was like really the first study but also a lot of the like alpha amino acids that we use in our proteins um are pretty upregulated in that one relative to some of the other structural isomers. But there are other there are other meteorites where it's like the complete opposite, right? And so they the like the history of those in terms of their kind of weathering and and things like like melting cycles, things like that is really plays a huge role in the content, the organic content that we detect. I also wanted to related to that. I wanted to mention um um uh smarter is it is that right? You you brought up um, you know, like deliver like net delivery versus um destruction, right? And an issue with that just experimentally like on on more like like experimental side is, you know, even if, you know, even if we do collect, you know, like a lot of a lot of meteorite on earth and we're, you know, we take it to our lab, the just the sample preparation that we perform to so that we can do organic analysis, you know, sometimes that actually could break down some of the more complex um organics that were present in there and we actually can't see them because just by just in order to extract them, you know, we have to use like really strong acid and things like that. And so, um it it could be it can there there are a lot of layers of complexity there. Um and also I I think it's important to note too that a lot of the analytical instrumentation that we send on like uh extraterrestrial rovers and things like that is quite limited compared to the instruments that we can we can use like here on earth. just because there's so many other factors that go into play, you know, you can't just, you know, you have to think about like like power requirements and weight and all these other things, right? And so, you know, like like uh, you know, one of the mass spectrometers in my research lab, you know, it's like 20 years old and it's like way out of date compared to a lot of a lot of other labs here on earth, but it's like the the the the analytical power that is actually much higher than like what's probably on these rovers that's going to like Mars and things like that, right? And so there are all these things that we have to consider which is why I'm really excited about Benu because I think that the ability for sample return is is huge. I think that that's massive. And uh I'm really excited to see what that study unfolds because I think that we'll be able to do a lot more in depth analysis of the organic content from than we can from what we're sending out elsewhere and it's not that that that stuff isn't important. It's obviously super important but there's just practically speaking there's a lot of difficulties that go into developing instrumentation for something like like a rover.",

Um, so rather than oil, you can also think about kerogen, um, which is a more solid form of a carbon it's it's a very complex thing. Um, certainly like it's preserved in ancient rocks on earth, but there is evidence that there is kerogenous type material on Mars. Um, biotic or abiotic, who knows, but you know, it's and Jay can correct me here. Um, my understanding is that there's kerogen within meteorites as well. So any any organic compounds being formed in a meteorite or other parent body can form kerogen. So the challenge then is um distinguishing biotic kerogen from abiotic kerogen. Um, in terms of uh, you know, drilling, you know, in terms of Mars, you can really go down like a meter. There are some platforms being developed um with drills, but it's it's fairly short. But what you can do instead is go to areas where ancient rocks are exposed, um recently exposed. So you can look at meter um craters, you know, impacts, things where things have um areas where things have been excavated. Um, so it's it is a possibility to look for that. Um, but again, it might be difficult uh to put it in the in the framework that Vicky was talking about assessing false positives.",

So it's just one question I think is exciting and and I don't think we we really know anything about like how many other trials did evolution make in terms of rise increasing complexity discretely and then they these other attempts just were out competed and faded out.

And so, you know, we we think of cells as bags of water, but the water in the in the cell is actually not as free flowing as it would be like elsewhere, right? And there's it's a cell is so concentrated with materials that like the medium it is it you know, it it like it's not like normal water in a sense, right? And so I'm wondering if there would be a way to like and and maybe people have done this already and I I just haven't seen that literature. Um, but kind of like studied um, like different water activities and like some of these like basic like basic processes and and seeing how that influences um, you know, like like like simple like metabolism like reactions, things like that.
